title: Trustlines Network Code of Conduct
---

The [Trustlines Network](https://trustlines.network/) ecosystem is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We are committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment.

This code of conduct applies to all Trustlines Network spaces. Including the [Trustlines Forum](https://forum.trustlines.network/), the [/r/Trustlines subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/Trustlines), the community [Trustlines Network Telegram group](https://t.me/trustlines_network), and any future ones not listed here, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the admins and moderators.

Some Trustlines Network spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity, and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

We pledge to be vigilant and supportive of our peers if they experience discrimination, harassment, or victimization.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community admins and moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community admins and moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

!!! abstract "Examples of representing our community"

    - Using an official email address.
    - Posting via an official social media account.
    - Acting as an (appointed) representative of the ecosystem at an online or offline event.

This code of conduct applies to Trustlines Network spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Trustlines Network outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Trustlines Network members, especially the admins and moderators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Trustlines Network community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Trustlines Network spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Trustlines Network community.

## Enforcement

All community admins and moderators are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the admins and moderators at the [Trustlines Forum](https://forum.trustlines.network/about), [Trustlines sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trustlines/about/moderators/), the community [Trustlines Network Telegram group](https://t.me/trustlines_network), or to <info@trustlines.network>. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

In order to protect the admins and moderators from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints or privately warn third parties about them if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Trustlines Network members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
