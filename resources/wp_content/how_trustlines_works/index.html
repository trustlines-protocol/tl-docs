<p>The Trustlines Protocol is an open-source technology stack that provides a highly accessible medium of exchange. Its core idea is to provide an accounting system based on peer-to-peer credit. This is a highly accessible financial tool since any two people who trust each other can decide to open a <abbr title="An (informal) agreement between two trusting users (e.g., friends) that allows one user to draw on credit given by the other. A credit line exists in the context of a currency network and, therefore, implicitly states the currency in which the accounting is done.">credit line</abbr> at any time, without typical restrictions like needing a bank account or identity documents. Credit is a powerful medium of exchange: Even if someone does not have access to national currency (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp#:~:text=Fiat%20money%20is%20government%2Dissued,the%20government%20that%20issued%20it.">fiat money</a>), the credit created on Trustlines Protocol could be used in its place.</p>
<p>When designing for financial inclusion, it is important to use accessible, decentralized technology. That is the goal of public blockchain technology: It can provide a permissionless and censorship-resistant platform. This is why Trustlines Protocol was designed to be implemented on a blockchain.</p>
<p>There are many faults with the modern monetary system, in which the majority of money is created as debt by commercial banks. There are also weaknesses to using cryptocurrencies, which remain structurally inaccessible for most people. These can be mitigated by switching to a decentralized, credit-based monetary system, as is possible with the Trustlines Protocol.</p>
<p>The combination of an accessible medium of exchange and decentralized infrastructure is what makes Trustlines the starting point for a truly decentralized monetary system.</p>

<p>In this example, Alice and Bob each give a <abbr title="An (informal) agreement between two trusting users (e.g., friends) that allows one user to draw on credit given by the other.

<p>Before the transfer, Bob's balance with Alice was zero. Bob's balance with Charlie was also zero. During the transfer, Bob's balance with Alice increased to "plus five," while his balance with Charlie decreased to "minus five." However, Bob's net balance remains unchanged at zero (-5+5=0).

<p>People that are not connected through <abbr title="A trustline can be defined as a bilateral credit/trust relationship between individual people or entities.

<p>Leveraging the network effect, users only need a small amount of trustlines to transact with a large number of people. This is clearer in the context of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">six degrees of separation</a> concept.</p>
<p>The greater effect is that the rippled credit can be used as a medium of exchange in small, dense, circular economies. However, because it would naturally connect these small economies, it may equally serve as a medium of exchange for a global economy. Trustlines could turn existing trusted relationships into liquid payment networks that look and act like regular money.</p>
<h3 id="26-fault-tolerance">2.6 Fault tolerance<a class="headerlink" href="#26-fault-tolerance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>So, why not create fake accounts with "fake credit" to use in the network? This can't actually do much damage because the system relies on individual, trusted relationships. This is important to consider for designing scalable systems.</p>
<p><center><div class="captioned_image lightgallery"><a data-sub-html="" href="../../../assets/images/wp_content/how_tl_works/how_tl_works05.png"><img class="tc_img" src="../../../assets/images/wp_content/how_tl_works/how_tl_works05.png"></a></div></center></p>
<p>For example, Eve created duplicate accounts to give herself millions in fake credit. But Eve's spending limit with the network is determined by the credit limit her friends have given her. In this example, Alice has given Eve a credit limit of ten. Because she knows Eve in real life and opening a Trustline needs the approval of both parties involved, Alice isn't going to create additional trustlines with the duplicate Eve accounts. Nor is she going to accept millions in credit from the real Eve.</p>
<p>The system is naturally fault-tolerant because each trustline is bilateral. In other words, <abbr title="A trustline can be defined as a bilateral credit/trust relationship between individual people or entities. It encompasses two credit lines (each party giving one to the other party) as well as a balance which indicates if and how much credit one party has drawn from the other.">a trustline</abbr> can affect only the two users who created it. Even if Eve manages to fool Alice, it will not affect the rest of the network.</p>

<p>Because <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/59/1/63/1516727">social norms affect informal enforceability</a>, all users do have tangible social incentives to respect their obligations--whether or not there exists an external contract or collateral. Defaulting would have a negative impact on the user's social relationship with their trustline partner. It could also affect a user's reputation with the rest of the community.</p>
<p>In case of a user not being able to pay back the obligation, there's also always the option to forgive the debt or settle in other ways than first anticipated. Payment from the creditor to the debtor would reflect this.</p>
<p>As long as all trustlines and transactions are notarized on secure, auditable infrastructure, there can be a tamper-proof record of all credit agreements and their balances. This reduces the possibility of disputes.</p>
<h3 id="28-interoperable-credit-systems">2.8 Interoperable credit systems<a class="headerlink" href="#28-interoperable-credit-systems" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Although the system is naturally decentralized, it is possible to create layers of centralized systems on top of it. This is possible by creating organization accounts that create trustlines with their members based on accepted community rules. Creating such configurations of trustline relationships can serve the greater effect of "socializing" the risk of default within a defined group.</p>
<p>The advantage to creating centralized systems using Trustlines is that these organizations would be inherently interoperable with other organizations, as well as with individuals, as long as all entities are connected in the network. <abbr title="A trustline can be defined as a bilateral credit/trust relationship between individual people or entities. It encompasses two credit lines (each party giving one to the other party) as well as a balance which indicates if and how much credit one party has drawn from the other.">A trustline</abbr> can also be used to directly connect two organization accounts, which would connect groups using centralized methods. But because the network is based on individual trusted relationships, they do not need to do so in order to connect. Disparate communities using Trustlines will remain connected at the edges, wherever they are naturally interconnected by individual friends and families.</p>
<p>This variety of possible credit configurations on Trustlines provide the flexibility to realistically represent real trust relationships in existing economies, and thus also naturally represent the boundaries between different communities. This is because natural economic borders would emerge between communities where there are fewer trusted relationships.</p>

<p>The Trustlines Protocol was designed to include an <a href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e">EVM-based</a> blockchain, which is decentralized peer-to-peer technology. A blockchain is often referred to as "trustless" infrastructure which provides tamper-proof accounting, censorship-resistance, and relies on a decentralized governance of the system.</p>
<p>Censorship-resistant public blockchains are designed with the goal that no hacker entity, corporation, or state can tamper with transactions, freeze accounts, or shut down the blockchain.</p>

There is also a Blockchain Explorer for TLBC: <a href="https://explore.tlbc.trustlines.foundation/">https://explore.tlbc.trustlines.foundation/</a>.</p>
<p>TLBC is based on <a href="https://openethereum.github.io/Aura">Parity's Aura consensus algorithm</a>. Aura (known from Kovan, xDAI, and others) is usually used in Proof-of-Authority chains. For our purposes of making it suitable for mPoS, we rely on the following additional features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Staking and slashing mechanisms to combat equivocation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hard-forking as an extra defense mechanism</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.1.1 Aura description</h4>
<p>Aura uses a predefined set of public authorities that fill in as validators. These authorities get assigned time slots in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling">round-robin</a> fashion. They then produce a block that increases the blockchain length. Block finality is reached if more than 50% of validators build on top of the produced block. This relies on an honest and online majority assumption, as well as an asynchronous network.</p>
<h4>4.1.2 mPoS (minimal viable Proof of Stake)</h4>
<p>In contrast to Proof-of-Authority blockchains, in the mPoS system, validators are pseudo-anonymous. Introducing pseudo-anonymous validators creates the need to ensure that no entity can get 51% of the voting power. Popular Proof of Stake chains with pseudo-anonymous validators, like Ethereum 2.0, can achieve this because it would be prohibitively expensive to buy 51% of the voting power. A new and unknown blockchain, such as the Trustlines Blockchain, cannot prevent a <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-51-percent-attack">51% attack</a> the same way.</p>
<p>To prevent this kind of attack, mPoS is designed to place additional restrictions on validators. These <a href="https://blog.trustlines.network/trustlines-validator-spotlight-deep-dive-on-rewards-economics-and-opportunities-for-validators/">validators</a> are defined through a <a href="https://blog.trustlines.network/summary-and-results-of-the-second-trustlines-validator-auction/"><abbr title="A Trustlines validator is a person or entity that is part of the active validator set of the Trustlines Blockchain. The validators have the responsibility of ensuring the security of the Trustlines Blockchain by validating transactions and adding blocks to the existing blockchain. Additionally, Trustlines validators monitor the Trustlines bridge to ensure a Trustlines Network Token to Trustlines Network Coin transfer and decide on blockchain forks and resulting protocol changes with the rest of the  Trustlines ecosystem.">validator</abbr> auction</a>.

<p>It is important that validators stake some amount of <abbr title="TLN are ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum chain, which can be converted to TLC by sending them to the Trustlines Blockchain bridge.">TLN</abbr>, to prevent certain attacks.

Adding the mPoS features creates a consensus algorithm with sufficient safety measures for TLBC.</p>
<h4>4.1.3 Hard-forking as an additional security option</h4>
<p>Pseudo-anonymous validators and mPoS features cannot ensure security from all attacks and threats. Such attacks and threats would include, but would not be limited to, inactive validators, reorganization of blocks by collusion, withholding blocks, building empty blocks, censoring transactions, or filling blocks with unusable information. Thus, as an additional defense mechanism, TLBC is intended to hard-fork to address these security risks and threats.</p>
<p>Hard-forks are a simple, yet powerful way to remove misbehaving validators. They can also prevent other attack scenarios without slashing deposits of the validators. Since we expect a well-aligned community, we assume that coordination efforts around this will be manageable. Hard-forks should thus become reasonably easy to execute. Distribution of agreed-upon updates resulting in hard-forks can occur via updates and/or via a configuration file. The configuration file would be available at the <a href="http://github.com/trustlines-protocol/">Trustlines Protocol GitHub</a> organization. The validators can then add the changed configuration into their clients/nodes.</p>
