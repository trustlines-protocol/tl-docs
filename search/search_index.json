The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Types \u00b6 Note Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Abstract Example: !!! abstract / summary / tldr Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Abstract Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Info Example: !!! info / todo Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Info Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Tip Example: !!! tip / hint Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Tip Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Warning Example: !!! warning / caution / attention Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Warning Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Failure Example: !!! failure / fail / missing Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Failure Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Danger Example: !!! danger / error Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Danger Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Bug Example: !!! bug Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Bug Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Example Example: !!! example / snippet Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Example Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quote Example: !!! quote / cite Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Quote Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the block title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can easily be changed by adding a quoted string after the type qualifier. Example: !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to setting a custom title, the icon and title can be omitted by providing an empty string after the type qualifier: Example: !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Embedded code blocks \u00b6 Example: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. import Messenger , { providers } from '@aragon/messenger' import { defer } from 'rxjs/observable/defer' import { empty } from 'rxjs/observable/empty' import { fromPromise } from 'rxjs/observable/fromPromise' import { merge } from 'rxjs/observable/merge' export const AppProxyHandler = { get ( target , name , receiver ) { if ( name in target ) { return target [ name ] } return function (... params ) { return target . rpc . sendAndObserveResponse ( 'intent' , [ name , ... params ] ). pluck ( 'result' ) } } } Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Footnotes \u00b6 Usage \u00b6 The markup for footnotes is similar to the standard Markdown markup for links. A reference is inserted in the text, which can then be defined at any point in the document. Inserting the reference The footnote reference is enclosed in square brackets and starts with a caret, followed by an arbitrary label which may contain numeric identifiers [1, 2, 3, ...] or names [Granovetter et al. 1998]. The rendered references are always consecutive superscripted numbers. Example: Lorem ipsum[^1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2] Result: Lorem ipsum 1 dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 2 Inserting the content The footnote content is also declared with a label, which must match the label used for the footnote reference. It can be inserted at an arbitrary position in the document and is always rendered at the bottom of the page. Furthermore, a backlink is automatically added to the footnote reference. on a single line Short statements can be written on the same line. Example: [^1]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Jump to footnote at the bottom of the page on multiple lines Paragraphs should be written on the next line. As with all Markdown blocks, the content must be indented by four spaces. Example: [^2]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Jump to footnote at the bottom of the page Tasklists \u00b6 Tasklists are useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: - [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit - [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper - [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt - [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst - [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus - [ ] Praesent sed risus massa - [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque - [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Code Highlighting \u00b6 Using Markdown syntaxes, code blocks can be opened and closed by writing three backticks on separate lines. To add code highlighting to those blocks, the easiest way is to specify the language directly after the opening block. Examples: ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` ``` javascript import Messenger, { providers } from '@aragon/messenger' import { defer } from 'rxjs/observable/defer' import { empty } from 'rxjs/observable/empty' import { fromPromise } from 'rxjs/observable/fromPromise' import { merge } from 'rxjs/observable/merge' export const AppProxyHandler = { get (target, name, receiver) { if (name in target) { return target[name] } return function (...params) { return target.rpc.sendAndObserveResponse( 'intent', [name, ...params] ).pluck('result') } } } ``` Results: import tensorflow as tf import Messenger , { providers } from '@aragon/messenger' import { defer } from 'rxjs/observable/defer' import { empty } from 'rxjs/observable/empty' import { fromPromise } from 'rxjs/observable/fromPromise' import { merge } from 'rxjs/observable/merge' export const AppProxyHandler = { get ( target , name , receiver ) { if ( name in target ) { return target [ name ] } return function (... params ) { return target . rpc . sendAndObserveResponse ( 'intent' , [ name , ... params ] ). pluck ( 'result' ) } } } Supported languages \u00b6 The Code Highlighting uses Pygments , a generic syntax highlighter. It supports over 300 languages . Grouping code blocks \u00b6 You can use grouping for code blocks with tabs. Example: === \"Bash\" ```bash #!/bin/bash echo \"Hello world!\" ``` === \"C\" ```c #include <stdio.h> int main(void) { printf(\"Hello world!\\n\"); } ``` === \"C++\" ```c++ #include <iostream> int main(void) { std::cout << \"Hello world!\" << std::endl; return 0; } ``` Result: Bash #!/bin/bash echo \"Hello world!\" C #include <stdio.h> int main ( void ) { printf ( \"Hello world! \\n \" ); } C++ #include <iostream> int main ( void ) { std :: cout << \"Hello world!\" << std :: endl ; return 0 ; } Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. Line counts start at 1. Example: ``` python hl_lines=\"2 3\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` ``` Result: def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. \u21a9 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Projects operating as separately incorporated entities within the Trustlines Network ecosystem may have their own trademark guidelines. 1. The Trustlines Foundation's Trademarks \u00b6 Our trademarks include but are not limited to our TRUSTLINES \u00ae trademark our TRUSTLINES NETWORK \u00ae trademark our \"Trustlines unicorn logo\" design trademark: This list may be updated from time to time, especially as other trademarks are created or registered. 2. Rules Applicable to Trademarks Owned by Trustlines Foundation \u00b6 One of the guiding principles of the Trustlines Network vision is open source. The Trustlines Foundation both hopes and encourages external parties to share knowledge related to the Trustlines Protocol and the Trustlines Network. It also advocates the promotion of the trademarks used for products built using the Trustlines Protocol. Therefore, contributors to and participants in the Trustlines ecosystem should be able to use our trademarks to promote their Trustlines projects even beyond the right to fair use. However, we have to keep in mind that the incorrect use of a brand may lead to a dilution of the trademark and, thus, to impairment due to a lack of differentiation from other brands. If its owner does not adequately protect it, a brand may weaken in meaning or become a generic term and lose its protected status. Some words were once trademarks that became generic terms because their owner did not adequately protect them. Therefore, we established the following rules for the use of Trustlines trademarks. Follow these guidelines to properly use the Trustlines trademarks to help maintain the value of our trademarks and the Trustlines brand. 2.1 Our Five Rules for the use of Trustlines trademarks \u00b6 If you want to use the Trustlines trademarks, you don't require Trustlines Foundations explicit prior permission or license agreement as long as you follow these rules. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to alter and amend these rules, to determine when these rules are adhered too or violated, and to choose appropriate enforcement measures. 2.1.1 - Rule #1 The ecosystem rule Refer to Trustlines or use the trademark and logo only when promoting products, projects, or events based on or about the Trustlines Protocol and in accordance with the disclaimer below. Use of the Trustlines trademarks when referring to other software or technologies , would be misleading to the audience, as well as damaging to the Trustlines brand and ecosystem. Therefore, Trustlines trademarks must not be used when referring to software based on protocols by other entities or in another misleading or unfair manner. Any use of the trademarks in these contexts could potentially subject you to liability for trademark infringement, false advertising, and unfair competition. 2.1.2 - Rule #2 Use your brand and add Trustlines as an ingredient brand It must be clear who the owner or marketer of the promoted product, project, or event is. Use the Trustlines trademarks only as a reference. There must be no potential for confusion or misunderstanding as to such that the product, project, or event is manufactured, marketed, sponsored, endorsed, or authorized by Trustlines Foundation, when in fact, that is not the case. The reference to Trustlines only shows that your product or project uses the Trustlines Protocol or your event is about the Trustlines Protocol or the Trustlines Network. Your name, brand, or trademark must not be less prominent than the Trustlines trademarks, and Trustlines must not be the only visible name, brand, or trademark on your online/offline communication. To make it clear for your audience or users that the Trustlines Protocol or the Trustlines Network is used for your project use wording such as, for example, \" Powered by Trustlines \u00ae Protocol \" or \" Powered with Trustlines Network \u00ae . \"If you are promoting a strictly non-profit and free-entry event regarding the Trustlines Protocol and/or Trustlines Network, you may use the trademarks as a primary brand for the event title. 2.1.3 - Rule #3 Use Trustlines trademarks according to our brand guidelines Use the word Trustlines or Trustlines Network in the same font and size as the surrounding text. For the logo , usage follows the Brand Guidelines . 2.1.4 - Rule #4 Use the trademark as an adjective A trademark function as an adjective and must be used accordingly, so don't use it as a noun, in the plural form, or the possessive case. Always use the Trustlines trademark as an adjective preceded or followed by the appropriate generic noun for the product or product category (e.g., \" Trustlines Network \u00ae relay server ,\" \" Trustlines \u00ae pathfinding service \"; not: \" App for Trustlining \" ). Only when referencing Trustlines Foundation as an entity or the Trustlines Network as the blockchain network, it is acceptable and appropriate to use Trustlines as a noun (e.g. \" deployed on the Trustlines Network ,\" not: \" The Trustline \" ) 2.1.5 - Rule #5 Integrity of the Trustlines trademarks and recognition notice Do not incorporate the Trustlines trademarks or any recognizable part of them into other logos, brand names, company names, domain names, or product names. Make it clear that Trustlines Foundation legally owns the Trustlines trademarks. If you are referring to a Trustlines trademark, add the following brand recognition notice at a suitable location, such as on your product, in print material or online: \"Trustlines \u00ae, Trustlines Network \u00ae, and the Trustlines unicorn logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Trustlines Foundation.\" 2.2 Quick check flow chart \u00b6 To get a quick idea about whether or not your intended use of the trademark is allowed without asking the Trustlines Foundation first, you can go through the following flow chart. Please keep in mind that this is just a quick check, and you should always refer to the full rules or ask us when you're in doubt about your use case scenario. 2.3 Examples for rules #1 and #2 \u00b6 For your convenience, see below some examples of how the rules #1 and #2 should be applied. Please keep in mind that these are just basic examples, and you should always refer to the full rules and take your case into account. Ask us when you're in doubt about your use case scenario.

Please describe your project and your intended use of the trademarks, why it deviates from our five rules, and why that makes sense for the ecosystem. We'll then examine whether we can issue a fitting license for your intended purpose and get back to you as quickly as possible. We reserve the right to refuse permission to use our trademarks for any reason. 4. What is a trademark? \u00b6 You may think of trademarks as a type of consumer protection mechanism. They help identify a certain business such as a manufacturer or a service provider and distinguish them from other market participants in the same market space. A trademark may be, for example, any word, name, or symbol that is used by a person or entity to identify and distinguish their goods and services from those offered by others and to indicate the source or origin of their goods and services. In many jurisdictions, it is not required to register a trademark with the government before claiming rights in the mark. 5. Rules that Apply to Trademarks In General \u00b6 The owner of a trademark in the EU, for example, is entitled to prevent all third parties not having their consent from using in the course of trade, in relation to goods or services, any sign where, for example, the sign is identical with, or similar to, the trademark and is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with, or similar to, the goods or services for which the EU trademark is registered, if there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public; the likelihood of confusion includes the likelihood of association between the sign and the trademark. The following, in particular, may be prohibited affixing the sign to the goods or the packaging of those goods; offering the goods, putting them on the market, or stocking them for those purposes under the sign, or offering or supplying services thereunder; importing or exporting the goods under the sign; using the sign as a trade or company name or part of a trade or company name; using the sign on business papers and in advertising; using the sign on comparative advertising in a manner that is contrary to Directive 2006/114/EC. 6. Fair Use \u00b6 The exclusive rights conferred by a trademark do not entitle the proprietor to prohibit the use of signs or indications by third parties which are used fairly and thus in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. The use of descriptive or non-distinctive signs or indications, in general, is also permitted. Furthermore, the proprietor is not entitled to prevent the fair and honest use of the trademark for the purpose of identifying or referring to the goods or services as those of the proprietor. Trademark laws should also be applied in a way that ensures full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms , and in particular, the freedom of expression . 7. Questions, Comments, Reporting of misuse \u00b6 Please do not hesitate to reach out to by email to contact@trustlines.foundation (i) in case of doubt, interpretation issues or general questions regarding the Trustlines Foundation trademark guidelines, (ii) if you want to obtain permission to use the Trademarks, or if you want to report misuse of the Trademarks. The Trustlines Foundation's privacy policy can be found here . 8. Disclaimer \u00b6 The Trustlines Foundation shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages relating to or resulting from Trademark user's usage of the Trademarks. Trademark users by their Trademark use agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Trustlines Foundation, its affiliates, and its contributors for any such claims for damages. The Trustlines Foundation does not make any express or implied warranties, by fact or law, including but not limited to warranties with regard to non-infringement of any third-party intellectual property rights. By using the Trustlines trademarks you agree that any material and/or the promoted product, project or event (i) is neither threatening, libelous, defamatory, nor obscene; (ii) would not constitute, or encourage conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate the law; (iii) doesn't infringe the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of any third parties; (iv) doesn't contain a computer virus or other destructive elements; (v) doesn't contain advertising; and (vi) doesn't constitute or contain false or misleading statements. 9.

Therefore, please make sure to check this page regularly if you are using Trustlines trademarks based on these guidelines without our prior written permission from Trustlines Foundation and adjust your trademark usage according to any changes made to our trademark guidelines. 10. Review and Remedies \u00b6 We reserve the right to review all uses of our trademarks by others and may conduct periodic spot checks of such use. Upon our request, you must provide a copy of any materials bearing our trademark. You must correct any deficiencies in the use of our trademarks. Refusal to correct such deficiencies may result in the revocation of permission to use our trademarks. Furthermore, any unauthorized or improper use of our trademarks may constitute trademark infringement, unfair competition, and/or copyright infringement in violation of applicable laws and regulations. We reserve the right to initiate legal action relating to any third party use of our trademarks that we, in our sole discretion, deem to be unlawful or improper, even if such use is not expressly prohibited in these guidelines. Nothing in our trademark guidelines is intended to waive or restrict any legal rights that we may have under applicable law, to grant any license, or to acquiesce in any infringing act.","title":"Trustlines Trademark Guidelines"},{"location":"foundation/trademarks/#1-the-trustlines-foundations-trademarks","text":"Our trademarks include but are not limited to our TRUSTLINES \u00ae trademark our TRUSTLINES NETWORK \u00ae trademark our \"Trustlines unicorn logo\" design trademark: This list may be updated from time to time, especially as other trademarks are created or registered.","title":"1.

A\u00fan en tiempos de abundancia, la falta de acceso a herramientas financieras sencillas puede causar problemas en la disponibilidad de un medio de cambio (ej. pensemos en las dificultades asociadas a no estar en el sistema bancario).

El cr\u00e9dito mutuo es una forma org\u00e1nica y accesible que sencillamente consiste en cr\u00e9ditos y d\u00e9bitos entre dos partes iguales que poseen confianza mutua. Dos personas pueden elegir hacer transacciones entre s\u00ed usando el principio de cr\u00e9dito mutuo al crear una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito informal bilateral entre s\u00ed, a la cual se refiere como una \u201ctrustline.\u201d Si se formalizan estos acuerdos informales naturales en una base de datos digital de amigos de confianza, se adquiere la posibilidad de \u201csaltar\u201d transacciones entre una red conectada de amigos-de-amigos.

Una vez creada la cuenta, puedes elegir tu nombre dentro de la app. 3.- Despu\u00e9s de elegir un nombre que desees usar en la aplicaci\u00f3n, \u00a1est\u00e1s listo para crear tu primera trustline! Puedes a\u00f1adir a tu compa\u00f1ero escaneando su c\u00f3digo QR o ingresando su direcci\u00f3n. \u00a1Aseg\u00farate de ponerles un nombre para que puedas ver f\u00e1cilmente con qui\u00e9n est\u00e1s interactuando! Tambi\u00e9n puedes omitir este paso y crear una nueva trustline m\u00e1s adelante, \u00a1pero la aplicaci\u00f3n no es \u00fatil sin al menos una! 4.- Tras agregar a tu compa\u00f1ero, deber\u00e1s escoger una red de divisas para esta trustline. En la siguiente pantalla deber\u00e1s escoger el l\u00edmite de cr\u00e9dito de la trustline. 5.- Revisa y aprueba los detalles de la trustline que deseas crear antes de enviarla, y listo, \u00a1est\u00e1s listo para usar la aplicaci\u00f3n de Trustlines! Asegurando el acceso a tu cuenta de Trustlines \u00b6 Este es un proceso muy importante que debe hacer cada usuario de la plataforma. Nota Esto no es lo mismo que hacer una copia de seguridad de tu cuenta. Esto asegurar\u00e1 el acceso a tu cuenta, pero tambi\u00e9n deber\u00edas asegurarte de que los datos de tu cuenta est\u00e9n asegurados. Copiar tu frase de seguridad garantizar\u00e1 que podr\u00e1s entrar a tu cuenta en caso de que no tengas acceso a tu dispositivo. Sin la frase de seguridad, no podr\u00e1s acceder a tu cuenta en otro dispositivo. 1.- Para iniciar, ve a la pesta\u00f1a Cuenta en la barra de men\u00fa. All\u00ed, selecciona Frase de Seguridad para iniciar el proceso de resguardo. 2.- El siguiente paso te mostrar\u00e1 la frase de seguridad personal asociada con tu cuenta. Esta frase de seguridad tiene 12 palabras. Debes copiarlas en un lugar seguro, como un administrador de contrase\u00f1as. Despu\u00e9s de copiar tu frase, deber\u00e1s verificar que la hayas guardado correctamente. La aplicaci\u00f3n te pedir\u00e1 que ingreses la frase de seguridad de 12 palabras en el orden correcto, asegur\u00e1ndose as\u00ed de que la hayas copiado correctamente y permiti\u00e9ndote acceder a tu cuenta en el futuro si es necesario. Estos son todos los pasos necesarios para asegurar el acceso a tu cuenta. Como recordatorio, guardar tu frase de seguridad como captura de pantalla, en tu email o un servicio en la nube no es una forma segura de almacenarla . Respaldar y restaurar los datos de tu cuenta \u00b6 Todos los datos personales de tu cuenta se almacenan s\u00f3lo en tu dispositivo. Si bien Trustlines Blockchain almacena informaci\u00f3n sobre tus saldos y transferencias, la informaci\u00f3n personal como los nombres de tus contactos y las solicitudes de pago solo se almacenan en tu dispositivo. Por eso es importante hacer una copia de seguridad de los datos de tu cuenta. Recomendamos hacer una copia de seguridad peri\u00f3dica de estos datos en caso de que tu tel\u00e9fono sea robado, se da\u00f1e o se pierda. El respaldo de los datos se hace en formato JSON, que podr\u00e1s f\u00e1cilmente guardar en el texto que prefieras. Para un usuario regular sin conocimiento del formato, esto se hace f\u00e1cilmente, y puede hacerse tan solo copiando y pegando la informaci\u00f3n para guardarla. He aqu\u00ed un ejemplo de c\u00f3mo se ver\u00eda la informaci\u00f3n de tu cuenta. { \"contacts\" : [{ \"address\" : \"0xdbF44585FD4C8fc748fB5b6f99d24f8540E0ebEc\" , \"username\" : \"Alice\" }, { \"address\" : \"0x062E470d519d5feCC78a501644B402d00BBbF393\" , \"username\" : \"Dan\" }], \"activeCurrencies\" : [{ \"address\" : \"0x57c4a2cCF2CC99f3dF7855465d1528C110Ff4F14\" }, { \"address\" : \"0x7Ac3fC1C428df99D81d9b644106FF67c44A155aA\" }], \"messages\" : [{ \"id\" : \"0x88DD2B76c8eAa369f38764EF71cEcF74F168a6f85262b8Aa66Ba22\" , \"direction\" : \"sent\" , \"networkAddress\" : \"0x7aF939CC78E5805d232752571cab0723613bD327\" , \"timestamp\" : 1606128428 , \"type\" : \"PaymentRequest\" , \"counterpartyAddress\" : \"0x21fa801a76196cEb92417c436eEf0a15EB57C649\" , \"accountAddress\" : \"0xB25bAb13E693CE19405A73F3c4A868aB32E46979\" , \"paymentRequestID\" : \"0xC7edf264F6218c9A\" , \"amount\" : \"10\" , \"subject\" : \"Lunch\" }], \"bills\" : [] } Hacer un respaldo de tu cuenta \u00b6 Dir\u00edgete a la pesta\u00f1a Cuentas en la barra de men\u00fa.

Restaurar una copia de Seguridad \u00b6 Dir\u00edgete a la pesta\u00f1a Cuentas en la barra de men\u00fa. All\u00ed encontrar\u00e1s la opci\u00f3n Restaurar datos. Esto te permitir\u00e1 pegar los datos para restaurar tus datos. Como se mencion\u00f3 anteriormente, los datos estar\u00e1n en un archivo de texto (archivo .txt), que puedes copiar y pegar desde donde los guardaste al realizar tu copia de seguridad. Creando una trustline \u00b6 \u00a1La aplicaci\u00f3n no es \u00fatil sin al menos una trustline! Si no tienes una, lo primero que hay que hacer al descargar la aplicaci\u00f3n es crear una trustline con un compa\u00f1ero de confianza. Para crear una trustline, primero, un compa\u00f1ero debe hacer una propuesta y luego el otro debe aceptarla. Cada trustline consta de dos l\u00edneas de cr\u00e9dito. De forma predeterminada, te sugerimos que establezcas ambos l\u00edmites en el mismo valor. Como cualquier otro acuerdo, es mejor discutir esto en conjunto mientras crean la trustline. Seleccionar el modo avanzado permitir\u00e1 establecer dos valores; a la izquierda es la cantidad que prestar\u00edas a tu compa\u00f1ero y a la derecha es la cantidad que puedes pedir prestada a tu compa\u00f1ero. Lo que puedes \"Pedir prestado\" se considera tu \"l\u00edmite de gasto\" con este compa\u00f1ero. Estas dos cantidades se pueden establecer seg\u00fan lo que tu compa\u00f1ero y t\u00fa acuerden. Algunas redes de divisas tambi\u00e9n tienen la opci\u00f3n de agregar intereses a cualquiera de estas l\u00edneas de cr\u00e9dito. Desde el Panel de control en la vista principal puedes iniciar el proceso tocando \u201cNueva trustline\u201d. 1.- El primer paso es seleccionar qu\u00e9 red de divisas y, por lo tanto, la denominaci\u00f3n que deseas utilizar para esta trustline espec\u00edfica. 2.- Luego, debes establecer un l\u00edmite de cr\u00e9dito para la trustline. Es mejor acordar esto en conjunto mientras crean la trustline. El modo avanzado ofrece m\u00e1s opciones si deseas establecer diferentes l\u00edmites de cr\u00e9dito para ti y tu compa\u00f1ero, c\u00f3mo agregar un inter\u00e9s personalizado para la trustline. 3.- Despu\u00e9s de seleccionar el l\u00edmite de cr\u00e9dito para la trustline, revisa bien la solicitud antes de seleccionar a tu compa\u00f1ero. En este punto, puedes elegir compartir un enlace para enviarlo a un destinatario, es decir, usando una aplicaci\u00f3n de mensajer\u00eda, correo electr\u00f3nico, etc., compartir tu c\u00f3digo QR para escanear, o puedes seleccionar a un compa\u00f1ero de la lista de contactos existentes, pegar la direcci\u00f3n de cuenta de tu compa\u00f1ero o escanear el c\u00f3digo QR. Al seleccionar la opci\u00f3n Compartir al elegir un compa\u00f1ero podr\u00e1s compartir tu propio c\u00f3digo QR o, de seleccionar Compartir nuevamente, para enviar un enlace de solicitud trustline a alguien. Ambas opciones contendr\u00e1n la informaci\u00f3n que se seleccion\u00f3 previamente para la solicitud de trustline. Si has seleccionado otra opci\u00f3n como un contacto existente, revisa los detalles asegurando que todo est\u00e9 correcto, y \u00a1env\u00eda tu solicitud! A\u00f1adiendo un contacto \u00b6 Para agregar un contacto, su compa\u00f1ero debe compartir la direcci\u00f3n de su cuenta. Para a\u00f1adir al contacto haz clic en Contactos en la barra de men\u00fa. En la parte superior de la pantalla, hay un bot\u00f3n para agregar nuevos contactos. Haz clic all\u00ed. El compa\u00f1ero que est\u00e1s agregando debe ir a la pesta\u00f1a Cuenta en la barra de men\u00fa y seleccionar Mostrar QR en la parte superior de la pantalla. Simplemente escanea su c\u00f3digo QR d\u00e1ndole al bot\u00f3n Escanear \u00a1Y listo! Si no est\u00e1n en el mismo espacio f\u00edsico, tu compa\u00f1ero tambi\u00e9n puede convertirse en tu contacto presionando Copiar direcci\u00f3n en Cuenta, enviando su direcci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de un servicio de mensajer\u00eda. \u00a1Aseg\u00farate de ingresar un nombre para tu compa\u00f1ero! Ponle un nombre que puedas reconocer f\u00e1cilmente. C\u00f3mo escoger una red de divisas \u00b6 Podr\u00e1s habilitar las redes de divisas para crear trutlines con diferentes denominaciones. Elige algo que te interese utilizar como una \"unidad de cuenta\". Las redes de divisas m\u00e1s populares son USD, EUR, Horas y Cerveza. Tambi\u00e9n puedes usar la moneda local. Para habilitar diferentes redes de divisas, simplemente selecciona la pesta\u00f1a Cuenta en el men\u00fa inferior y luego selecciona Divisas. Aqu\u00ed puedes habilitar o deshabilitar diferentes redes de divisas que podr\u00e1s utilizar. Las redes de divisas tambi\u00e9n se pueden habilitar durante el proceso de creaci\u00f3n de trustlines sin necesidad de habilitarlas por adelantado. Establecer un L\u00edmite de Cr\u00e9dito \u00b6 Cada trustline consta de dos l\u00edneas de cr\u00e9dito. De forma predeterminada, te sugerimos que establezcas ambos l\u00edmites en el mismo valor. Es mejor discutir esto en conjunto mientras establecen los n\u00fameros. Seleccionar el modo avanzado permitir\u00e1 establecer dos valores; a la izquierda es la cantidad que prestar\u00edas a tu compa\u00f1ero y a la derecha es la cantidad que puedes pedir prestada a tu compa\u00f1ero. Lo que puedes \"Pedir prestado\" se considera tu \"l\u00edmite de gasto\" con este compa\u00f1ero. Estas dos cantidades se pueden establecer seg\u00fan lo que tu compa\u00f1ero y t\u00fa acuerden. Algunas redes de divisas tambi\u00e9n tienen la opci\u00f3n de agregar intereses a cualquiera de estas l\u00edneas de cr\u00e9dito. Como ver tu l\u00edmite de cr\u00e9dito global \u00b6 Estando en Panel de control, ver\u00e1s un gran n\u00famero en la parte superior, con la palabra \"Disponible\" debajo, y los botones \"Enviar\" y \"Recibir\". Este n\u00famero no es tu saldo. En cambio, es tu cr\u00e9dito global disponible, la suma de todo el cr\u00e9dito disponible en cada trustline que hayas abierto dentro de una red de divisas en particular. (Es similar al l\u00edmite de cr\u00e9dito en una tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito). Este n\u00famero disminuir\u00e1 cada vez que realices un pago mediante la aplicaci\u00f3n Trustlines porque el pago agota el cr\u00e9dito disponible. Sin embargo, aumentar\u00e1 otra vez cuando recibas pagos, por ejemplo, si un amigo te paga con una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito que haya creado. En otras palabras, si un amigo te pide prestado algo de dinero (y por lo tanto te debe dinero), esta cantidad se registra como cr\u00e9dito adicional, adem\u00e1s de tu cr\u00e9dito disponible. Cuanto mayor sea tu l\u00edmite de cr\u00e9dito global, mayor ser\u00e1 tu capacidad de realizar pagos en la red. Si deseas aumentar tu l\u00edmite, crea m\u00e1s trustlines con m\u00e1s personas en las que conf\u00edes (o p\u00eddele a tus amigos que aumenten sus l\u00edmites de cr\u00e9dito contigo). Enviar y Recibir Pagos \u00b6 Enviar pagos mediante Trustlines \u00b6 Crear una trustline con una persona de confianza no s\u00f3lo te permite realizar transacciones con ella, sino tambi\u00e9n con todas las personas con las que est\u00e1 conectado tu amigo, y todas las personas con las que est\u00e1n conectados sus amigos, etc. Puedes distribuir pagos en muchas cadenas de amigos, siempre que haya un l\u00edmite de cr\u00e9dito suficientemente alto (suficiente \"capacidad\") en cada trustline conectada. Para enviar un pago a alguien que a\u00fan no conoces, puedes escanear su QR con la solicitud de pago o compartir un enlace de solicitud de pago a trav\u00e9s de un servicio de mensajer\u00eda. Si es alguien con quien planeas volver a realizar transacciones en el futuro, tambi\u00e9n puedes agregarlo como contacto (consulta Agregar un contacto). Si ya los tienes como contacto, puedes presionar Enviar directamente desde el Panel de control. Aseg\u00farate de seleccionar la red de divisas correcta antes de presionar Enviar. Solicitar pagos mediante Trustlines \u00b6 Para solicitar un pago a alguien, presiona el bot\u00f3n Solicitud en el Panel de control. Aseg\u00farate de seleccionar la red de divisas correcta antes de presionar Siguiente. Deber\u00e1s ingresar la cantidad que est\u00e1s solicitando, elegir un compa\u00f1ero al que enviar la solicitud y revisar la solicitud antes de confirmar. Tambi\u00e9n puedes dividir f\u00e1cilmente el pago entre varias personas seleccionando la opci\u00f3n \u201cDividir Factura\u201d / Split Bill\u201d. Al seleccionar Compartir al elegir un compa\u00f1ero, ver\u00e1s la opci\u00f3n de compartir tu propio c\u00f3digo QR o de seleccionar Compartir nuevamente puedes enviar el enlace de solicitud de pago a alguien m\u00e1s. Ambas opciones contendr\u00e1n la informaci\u00f3n previamente seleccionada en la solicitud de pago. Si has seleccionado otra opci\u00f3n, como un contacto existente, revisa los detalles, asegur\u00e1ndote de que todo est\u00e9 correcto, y \u00a1Env\u00eda tu solicitud! Dividir la cuenta \u00b6 Con la aplicaci\u00f3n Trustlines, puedes dividir f\u00e1cilmente un pago entre varias personas. Empieza a solicitar el pago como lo har\u00edas normalmente y, cuando llegues a la pantalla Elegir compa\u00f1ero, selecciona la opci\u00f3n \u201cDividir Factura / Split Bill\u201d. Aparecer\u00e1 la pantalla de solicitud de dividir factura, indicando que solicitas un pago entre varios contactos. A continuaci\u00f3n, selecciona a las personas a las que deseas enviar esta solicitud de pago. Tambi\u00e9n puedes incluirte a t\u00ed mismo en esta solicitud. Esto es especialmente \u00fatil si est\u00e1s dividiendo un pago de manera uniforme entre participantes de una actividad. De forma predeterminada, la cantidad que solicites se dividir\u00e1 en partes iguales entre las personas seleccionadas. Tambi\u00e9n existe la opci\u00f3n de cambiar las sumas manualmente ingresando las cantidades por persona. Revisa solicitud de pago y \u00a1Env\u00eda varias solicitudes con un solo click! Revisar los balances con mis contactos \u00b6 Al seleccionar un contacto en la vista de Contactos, ver\u00e1s todas las trustlines que tienes con esa persona. Desliza el dedo hacia la izquierda y hacia la derecha para ver diferentes redes de divisas. Cada trustline mostrar\u00e1 de forma destacada el cr\u00e9dito disponible en la parte superior. Debajo se muestran tres n\u00fameros: Saldo, L\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito otorgada y L\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito recibida. Los montos de las l\u00edneas de cr\u00e9dito otorgadas y recibidas corresponden a los dos l\u00edmites de cr\u00e9dito que tu compa\u00f1ero y t\u00fa acordaron para esta trustline. En otras palabras, esta es la l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito que le has dado a tu compa\u00f1ero y la l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito que has recibido de tu compa\u00f1ero. Tu saldo indica la cantidad \"adeudada\". Si es negativo, esta es la cantidad que le debes a tu compa\u00f1ero. Si es positivo, esta es la cantidad que te debe tu compa\u00f1ero a ti. Solo deber\u00edas necesitar esta informaci\u00f3n si decides liquidar tu saldo y cerrar la trustline. Soporte y Feedback \u00b6 Esta es una app lanzada recientemente.

First of all, you need to securely back up your passphrase , uninstall the beta version, and install the production version. You also need to do a backup of your account's data and content before uninstalling the beta version. Introduction \u00b6 In order for markets to function correctly, people need reliable access to a medium of exchange. Historically, due to how the world's banking system functions, this has been a difficult goal to reach. Even in times of abundance, a lack of access to simple financial tools can cause a breakdown in the availability of a medium of exchange (e.g., think of the many hardships associated with being \"unbanked\"). The problem becomes especially urgent in the face of economic recessions (which cause a scarcity of money). That is why we need a new form of money that can provide a medium of exchange that anyone can access: \"People Powered Money.\" Mutual Credit \u00b6 The Trustlines App is your key to using a form of money based on the idea of mutual credit . Mutual credit is an organic and accessible form of money that consists simply of credits and debits between two mutually trusted parties. Any two people can choose to transact with each other using the principle of mutual credit by creating an informal two-way credit line between them, referred to as a \"trustline.\" If you formalize these natural, informal agreements between trusted friends on a digital database, it becomes possible to \"ripple\" transactions through your network of connected friends-of-friends. That's the brilliant thing about using Trustlines: it turns trusted relationships into a payments network that looks and acts like \"real\" money. Getting started with the Trustlines App \u00b6 You might have received an invite link from someone to get started with the Trustlines App, or perhaps you've just downloaded the app and are ready to get started. These two processes differ a bit, and we have a guide for each approach. Select the appropriate choice for you, Starting via an invite link or Starting with a sign up in the app . Note to iOS users upgrading from an earlier version If you have the beta version Trustlines App installed on an iOS device with TestFlight, you will have to uninstall the beta version before installing the production version. First of all, you need to securely back up your passphrase , uninstall the beta version, and install the production version. You also need to do a backup of your account's data and content before uninstalling the beta version. Starting via an invite link \u00b6 You might have received an invite link from someone to get started with the Trustlines App. This link will allow you to easily set up your account as well as create your first trustline! The first thing you need to do when signing up for a new account is to accept the Terms & Conditions . Upon accepting the Terms & Conditions, the app will automatically generate a new account for you. Once the account generation is complete, you get to choose the name displayed for yourself. Choose a name you want to use in the app, and you're ready to create your first trustline! Since you created your account via an invite link, there is already a trustline request ready for you to review. This will show the name that the other person has picked for themselves, which currency network they are suggesting for the trustline, as well as the suggested credit limit(s). A trustline request from a new invite link is slightly different from others you will receive, and will become active only after it is sent back to your new partner for a final approval. That's it. You're ready to start using the Trustlines App! Starting with a sign up in the app \u00b6 Starting with a sign up in the app is pretty similar to starting via an invite link . There are a couple of fewer steps to take before getting to the Dashboard , but the app won't be very useful at this point until you create a trustline with someone. If you already went through the starting via an invite link steps, feel free to skip this section. The first thing you need to do when signing up for a new account is to accept the Terms & Conditions . Upon accepting the Terms & Conditions, the app will automatically generate a new account for you. Once the account generation is complete, you get to choose the name displayed for yourself. After choosing a name that you want to use in the app, you're ready to create your first trustline! You can enter your partner's address either by scanning their QR code or by entering the address to the input field. Make sure to enter a name for them as well so you will be able to easily see who you're interacting with! You can also skip this step and create a new trustline later, but the app is not useful without at least one trustline! Next, you will choose a currency network you would like to use for this trustline. On the next screen, you will need to choose and suggest a credit limit for this trustline. Review the details of the trustline you wish to request before sending, and that's it, you're ready to start using the Trustlines App! Securing access to your account \u00b6 Notice This is a crucial step for all users of the Trustlines App! Note This is not the same as backing up your account data . This will secure access to the account, but you should also make sure that the account data is backed up. Backing up your passphrase will guarantee that you will be able to access your account in the case that you lose access to your device. Without the passphrase, you won't be able to access your account again on another device. You start by going to the Account tab in the menu bar. There you need to select Passphrase to start the backing up process. The next step will show you the personal passphrase associated with your account. This passphrase is 12 words long, and you will need to copy it to a secure location like a password manager. After copying your passphrase, you will need to verify that you have the correct passphrase stored. The app will ask you to enter the 12-word passphrase in the correct order, ensuring that you have the right one copied and allowing you to access your account in the future if needed. These are all the steps needed to secure access to your account. As a reminder, storing your passphrase, i.e., in a screenshot, email, or at cloud storage, is not a secure way of storing your passphrase . Backing up and restoring your account data \u00b6 All the personal data of your account is stored only on your device. While the Trustlines Blockchain stores information regarding your balances and transfers, personal information like the names of your contacts and payment requests are only stored on your device. This is why it\u2019s important to back up your account data. We recommend doing a regular backup of this data in case your phone gets stolen, broken, or is otherwise lost. The information is stored in a JSON format that you can be easily store in text form any way you would prefer. For a regular user without knowledge about the formatting, this is done easy, and can be done by just copying and pasting the information to save it. Here's an example of how the data of your account data might look like. { \"contacts\" : [{ \"address\" : \"0xdbF44585FD4C8fc748fB5b6f99d24f8540E0ebEc\" , \"username\" : \"Alice\" }, { \"address\" : \"0x062E470d519d5feCC78a501644B402d00BBbF393\" , \"username\" : \"Dan\" }], \"activeCurrencies\" : [{ \"address\" : \"0x57c4a2cCF2CC99f3dF7855465d1528C110Ff4F14\" }, { \"address\" : \"0x7Ac3fC1C428df99D81d9b644106FF67c44A155aA\" }], \"messages\" : [{ \"id\" : \"0x88DD2B76c8eAa369f38764EF71cEcF74F168a6f85262b8Aa66Ba22\" , \"direction\" : \"sent\" , \"networkAddress\" : \"0x7aF939CC78E5805d232752571cab0723613bD327\" , \"timestamp\" : 1606128428 , \"type\" : \"PaymentRequest\" , \"counterpartyAddress\" : \"0x21fa801a76196cEb92417c436eEf0a15EB57C649\" , \"accountAddress\" : \"0xB25bAb13E693CE19405A73F3c4A868aB32E46979\" , \"paymentRequestID\" : \"0xC7edf264F6218c9A\" , \"amount\" : \"10\" , \"subject\" : \"Lunch\" }], \"bills\" : [] } Backing up your account data \u00b6 Head on over to the Accounts tab in the menu bar. There you will find the Backup data option. Hitting the Back It Up button will prompt a selection of how you want to save the data. As mentioned above, the data will be in text form, formatted as JSON data, which you can copy and save somewhere, or directly select an option to save it to your device. Restoring up your account data \u00b6 Head on over to the Accounts tab in the menu bar. There you will find the Restore data option. This will allow you to paste the data into the input field to restore your data. As mentioned above, the data will be in text form, formatted as JSON data, which you can copy and paste from where you have saved it while backing up your data . Creating a trustline \u00b6 The app is not useful without at least one trustline! So if you don't have one, the first thing you should do upon downloading the Trustlines App is to create a trustline with a trusted partner. To create a trustline, first, one party must create a proposal, and the other must accept it. Each trustline consists of two credit lines. As a default, we suggest you set both limits to the same value. It's best to discuss this together as you fill in the numbers. Selecting the Advanced Mode will allow you to set two values; the left is the amount you would lend, and the right is the amount you can borrow. \u201cBorrow\u201d can be thought of as your \u201cspend limit\u201d with this partner. These two amounts can be set to whatever values you and your partner agree on. Some currency networks also have an option to add interest to either of these credit lines. Start by heading to the Dashboard . Here you can either start the process by tapping on New Trustline . The first step is to select which currency network , and thus, denomination you wish to use for this specific trustline. Next, you need to set a credit limit for the trustline. It's best to discuss this together as you fill in the numbers. The Advanced Mode will provide you with more options if you wish to set different credit limits for you and your partner or add a custom interest for the trustline. After selecting the credit limit for the trustline, review the request before choosing a partner. Here you can select to share a link to be sent to a recipient, i.e., using a messaging app, email, etc., share your QR code to be scanned, or to select a partner from the list of existing contacts , paste in the partners account address , or scan their QR code . By selecting Share when choosing a partner, you will be shown the option to share your own QR code or to select Share again at the bottom of the screen to send a trustline request link to someone. Both of these options will contain the information that you previously selected for the trustline request. Then, if selecting another option like an existing contact, review the details, making sure everything is correct, and send the request! Adding a contact \u00b6 To add a contact, your partner must share their account address. You, adding the contact, should click on the Contacts item in the menu bar. At the top of the screen, there's a button for adding new contacts. Click this. Your partner sharing their contact information should go to the Account tab in the menu bar and select Show QR at the top of the screen. You can now scan this with your QR scanner by clicking on the Scan button. If you are not physically together, your partner can also become a contact by clicking Copy Address under Account and sending their wallet address to you via a messaging service. Make sure to enter a name for them as well! Make sure to label them with a name that you'll be able to recognize. Choosing currency networks to use \u00b6 You'll be able to enable currency networks to create trustlines using different denominations. Pick something you are interested in using purely as a \"unit of account.\" Popular currency networks are USD, EUR, Hours, and Beer. You may also want to use your local currency. To enable different currency networks, simply select the Account tab at the bottom menu bar and then select Currencies . Here you can enable, or disable, different currency networks that you can easily then use from your Dashboard . Currency networks can also be enabled during the trustline creation process on the go without the need to enable them in advance. Choosing a currency network for a trustline \u00b6 When presented with the Choose Currency Network screen, tap on More options to see the whole list of currency networks that you can choose from. The currency network denominations are used purely as a \"unit of account.\" Setting a credit limit \u00b6 Each trustline consists of two credit lines. As a default, you set both limits to the same value. It's best to discuss this together as you fill in the numbers. Selecting the Advanced Mode will allow you to set two values; the left is the amount you would lend, and the right is the amount you can borrow. \u201cBorrow\u201d can be thought of as your \u201cspend limit\u201d with this partner. These two amounts can be set to whatever values you and your partner agree on. There is also an option to add interest to either of these credit lines. Checking your global credit limit \u00b6 As you head on over to the Dashboard screen, you'll see a big number at the top, with the word \"Available\" underneath, and \"Send\" and \"Receive\" buttons. This number is not your balance. Instead, it is your available global credit, the sum of all the credit available on every trustline you have opened within a particular currency network. (It is similar to a credit limit on a credit card.) This number will go down whenever you make a payment using the Trustlines App because paying uses up available credit. But this number will go up when you receive payments, like if a friend pays you using a credit line that you have given to them. In other words, if a friend borrows some money from you (and thus owes you money), this amount is recorded as additional credit on top of your available credit. The higher your global credit limit is, the higher your capacity to make payments in the network. If you want to raise your limit, open more trustlines with more people that you trust (or ask existing friends to raise their credit limits with you). Sending and receiving payments \u00b6 Sending a payment \u00b6 Creating a trustline allows you to transact not just with this trusted friend, but also with all the people that your friend is connected to, and all the people their friends are connected to, etc. You can ripple payments across many chains of friends, as long as there is a high enough credit limit (enough \"capacity\") on each connected trustline. To send a payment to someone you don't yet know, you can use your QR scanner to directly scan their payment request or share a payment request link via a messaging service. If it's someone you plan to transact with again in the future, you can add them as a contact, too (see Adding a contact ). If you already have them as a contact, you can hit Send directly from the Dashboard . Make sure you swipe to select the right currency network before hitting Send . Requesting a payment \u00b6 To request a payment from someone, you hit the Request button in the Dashboard . Make sure you swipe to select the right currency network before hitting Request . You will need to enter the amount that you are requesting, choose a partner to send the request to, and review the request before confirming it. You can also easily split the payment between multiple people by selecting the Split Bill option (see Split request for more details). By selecting Share when choosing a partner, you will be shown the option to share your own QR code or to select Share again at the bottom of the screen to send the payment request link to someone. Both of these options will contain the information that you previously selected for the payment request. Then, if selecting another option like an existing contact, review the details, making sure everything is correct, and send the request! Split request \u00b6 With the Trustlines App, you can easily split a payment between multiple people. You start requesting payment as you normally would, and when you get to the Choose Partner screen, select the Split Bill option. You will be presented with a Split Request screen showing that you will be requesting a payment between multiple contacts. Next, you will select the people you wish to send this payment request to. You can also include yourself in this split payment request. This is especially useful if you are splitting a payment evenly among the participants. By default, the amount you're requesting will be split evenly between the people you chose. You also have the option here to change the sums manually by entering the amounts per person. Review the payment request and send multiple requests with a single tap! Checking balances with contacts \u00b6 By selecting a contact in the Contacts view, you will be able to view all the trustlines you have with that person. Swipe left and right to view different currency networks. Each trustline will prominently display the available credit at the top. Below are three numbers: Balance , Given credit line , and Received credit line . The given and received credit line amounts correspond to the two credit limits you and your partner have agreed on for this trustline. In other words, this is the credit line you have given to your partner, and the credit line you have received from your partner. Your balance indicates the amount \"owed.\" If it is negative, this is the amount you owe your partner. If it is positive, this is the amount your partner owes you. You should only need this information if you decide to settle your balance and close the trustline. Support and feedback \u00b6 This is a newly released app. We are very interested in hearing about your experiences, anything you had trouble with, and any feedback you might have.

Through the Trustlines Protocol, Trustlines enables \"People Powered Money\" to be used by anyone anywhere. The Trustlines Protocol is an open-source technology stack that provides a highly usable medium of exchange. Its core idea is to provide an accounting system based on peer-to-peer credit. This is a remarkably accessible financial tool since any two people who trust each other can decide to open a credit line at any time, without typical restrictions like needing a bank account or identity documents. Credit is a powerful medium of exchange: Even if someone does not have access to the national currency (fiat money), this mutual credit could be used in its place. When designing a protocol for financial inclusion, it is essential to use accessible, decentralized technology. A feature of public blockchain technology is that they provide a permissionless and censorship-resistant platform. This is why Trustlines Protocol was designed to be implemented on a blockchain. The combination of an accessible medium of exchange and decentralized infrastructure makes Trustlines the starting point for a genuinely decentralized monetary system. What is a trustline? A trustline can be defined as a bilateral credit/trust relationship between individual people or entities. It encompasses two credit lines (each party giving one to the other party) as well as a balance which indicates if and how much credit one party has drawn from the other. What is a credit line? A credit line can be referred to as an (informal) agreement between two trusting users (e.g., friends), which allows one user to draw on credit given by the other. A credit line exists in the context of a currency network and, therefore, implicitly states the currency in which the accounting is done. What are IOUs (I Owe You)? An IOU is defined as an informal acknowledgment issued in a trustline from one party to the other. An IOU reduces the amount of credit available to one party and increases the amount of credit available to the other. During a transfer, outstanding IOUs are set-off before the credit of a credit line is drawn. Who controls the credit (IOU) flow? The two people who share a trustline control the flow of that trustline. When one person sends a payment request to another person, it is up to the receiver to accept or reject that credit. Your trustline credit balance can also change as a result of a multi-hop payment . This can happen if payments get rippled through you. This can not exceed a credit limit you have set for a trustline. What is a balance? The balance refers to the value of an IOU within a trustline. If the value is 0, no IOU has been issued. What is a multi-hop payment? A multi-hop payment refers to the mechanism used when multiple users in a currency network cooperate (implicitly as part of the agreement with the network) to facilitate a transfer between users that have no direct trustline agreement. The path encompasses all involved users and their trustlines. The IOU transfer is exclusively between the sender and receiver (who exchanged something of value to receive an IOU in one of their trustlines). What is a path? A path refers to the trustlines used between the sender and receiver during a multihop payment (see multihop payment). The path encompasses all involved users and their involved trustlines. Can anyone issue a credit line, trustline, or create a currency network?\" Yes. How do you use Trustlines?\" Users are presumed to make use of the Trustlines Protocol (see Trustlines Protocol ) with an application. Can I change the credit I have given my friends? Yes. You can update the amount of credit you want to trust your friend with at any point in time, except if your friend has already exceeded the new limit you want to set before you update it. Do I need to connect my bank account to my Trustlines account? / Is it planned to implement an option to transfer fiat money or crypto at some point? No. The Trustlines concept uses only credit between two trusting entities, and settling balances should only happen rarely. Currently, there is no way to connect any other payment protocols to your Trustlines account, but this could change in the future. These connected accounts would only be used in the case of settling or closing trustlines. How do I settle a trustline with a friend? Agree on the conditions in the real world (e.g., your friend pays you with money for the amount of credit he's drawn, or you exchange a good or service in return for settlement) Update the Trustline balance How can I be sure that I will get paid by the person I have a trustline with. Trustlines is based on the principle that you should only create trustlines with the people you actually know and trust. Thus there is no guarantee that you will be paid aside from your trusted relationship with a person. You can reduce the risks when setting up a credit limit. Set a maximum amount that you're willing to lend to someone. You can start with a small amount, and later you can increase the limit if needed. What happens if my friend won't pay me back (defaulting)? Nothing will happen in the system, and you can continue using Trustlines. You may have lost some real-world value, which is why you should only give trustlines to people you trust and in amounts that you're, in the worst case, willing to lose. How do you close a trustline? Reduce the balance of your trustline to 0. Once this is done, either party can close the trustline. Can friends change the credit I give them? No. The person giving the credit line always sets the amount of credit they're willing to provide. Even though users can request a credit change, any change needs to be accepted by the creator/giver of the credit. Can the Trustlines Foundation, or any other entity, close my trustlines, block or delete my account? This would depend on the currency network you had created the trustline in. All currency networks that the Trustlines Foundation would initially deploy are set up in a way that no other entity can close, block, or delete a user. Signing any transaction requires access to your private key, which nobody should have access to besides you. Please be sure that any application you use to interact with the Trustlines Blockchain does not give access to your private key to any third party. Can I leave currency networks? Yes. To leave, you need to close all your trustlines in a given currency network. General \u00b6 What is the Trustlines Network? The Trustlines Network is an ecosystem of individuals, projects, and entities aligned on the idea of mapping trust-based relationships on to trustless infrastructure. No single entity owns, is, or can be in charge of this construct. What's the difference between Trustlines Network and Trustlines Protocol? The Trustlines Network aims to promote the financial and economic inclusion of all people through decentralized and open-source systems. It consists of all the people, organizations, and other entities, participating in creating and using the Trustlines Network ecosystem. The Trustlines Protocol represents a set of rules, processes, and definitions forged into deployable code, enabling the mapping of trust-based relationships onto trustless infrastructure. Read more about the protocol here . What problem are you solving? The Trustlines Foundation is the promoting financial and economic inclusion of all people through decentralized peer-to-peer network protocols that serve common accounting. How transparent is Trustlines? A significant level of transparency is achieved by using a public blockchain as a part of the Trustlines Protocol. Every address on the Trustlines Blockchain is a pseudo-anonymous as it is not linked to any other identity. Still, since every transaction on the blockchain is public, the address's history is always transparently visible to everyone. This means that if someone knows your address, they can view your transaction history. This allows full transparency and balance keeping of all addresses but cannot provide wholesome anonymity. Do you have a whitepaper? We have the whitepaper here at the Trustlines Docs. When will all of this be live? The Trustlines Blockchain went live on November 21 st . You can read more about the launch in the Launching the Trustlines Blockchain blog post . A blockchain explorer for the Trustlines Blockchain can be found at https://explore.tlbc.trustlines.foundation/ . Currency Networks \u00b6 What is a currency network? The Trustlines currency networks are the fundamental infrastructure of the Trustlines functionalities and are implemented on-chain. This contract type is the core smart contract that end users can interact with. The contract records all properties a currency network has (e.g., symbol, name of currency network, and fee structure) and account information (e.g., users - blockchain addresses, balances, and trustlines). Trustlines are modeled as \"accounts\" within the currency networks and keep a record of the credit lines two parties have agreed upon as well as their current balance. Are transfers of currency network IOUs and transfers of collateralized tokens (e.g., Bitcoin) the same? No. Collateralized tokens such as Bitcoin or Trustlines Network Coins (TLC) are backed by certain collateral such as hashing power (in the case of Bitcoin) or stake (in the case of TLC). Currency networks inherit their values from the trust that exists between the individual users on the network. Is it possible to use multiple currencies in one trustline? No. A single trustline represents one denomination of credit between two people. It is possible to create multiple trustlines with the same person using numerous currency networks. Still, they each require a single trustline for balance keeping. How do I join a currency network? To join a currency network, you need to send a Trustlines request to another person that is also using the Trustlines Blockchain. How do I create a currency network? Follow the specification for currency network smart contracts on our GitHub . Is it possible to make a currency network with interests set on trustlines? Yes, if this is enabled in the smart contract that defines the currency network, users can add interest rates on a trustline. This would allow the issuer of the IOU to increase his or her credit limit at the cost of an added interest fee. Is it possible to make a currency network with a limit on the no. of users that can join? Yes, though, this must be defined in the currency network smart contract. With no governance such as central banks or government, how can monetary policy be enforced? Smart contracts define the monetary policy of the currency network. A currency network creator can specify many conditions such as the maximum number of trustlines that a user can have the maximum value that a trustline can have whether interest can be added whether joining the network is open or permissioned/closed Relay Servers \u00b6 What are relay servers? The relay servers are an optional bridge between client applications and the Trustlines Blockchain. They offer services that are not feasible to be implemented on-chain or within the client apps. They are a back-end service that implements main features to connect the users to the smart contract system: Forwarding user signed transactions from a mobile app to the Trustlines Blockchain Indexing and storing event information Sending relevant blockchain events (including push notifications) to the mobile app Discovering a path between the sender and receiver in the graph of trustlines by using Dijkstra's Algorithm , considering the shortest path in a number of hops. Users do not need to trust relay servers with their accounts (private keys), as transactions are signed locally on their device and validated by the currency networks on the Trustlines Blockchain. What are the requirements for running a Relay Server? You can find the specifications needed to run a relay server on our GitHub relay repository . Do users need to use a path that is calculated by a relay server, or are there alternatives? It is possible to calculate and specify your own path or even use your own relay server. However, most users might prefer not to do so. How do relay servers collect topology for the pathfinding process? If the relay server uses the code which is provided by the Trustlines Foundation via GitHub , it will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the sender and receiver. Blockchain \u00b6 Why are you using a blockchain? Our design decision was to build the Trustlines Network as a decentralized P2P system. A blockchain is a natural fit for such a system because it is good at tamper-proof accounting, can, with the right design, provide censorship resistance, and allows for decentralized governance of the system. How does the sidechain work? The Trustlines Blockchain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ethereum sidechain based on Parity's Aura consensus algorithm . Aura (known from Kovan, poa.network, xDAI, and others) is usually used in Proof of Authority chains. We added the following features: Anonymous validators Staking and slashing mechanisms to combat equivocation Hard forking as an additional defense mechanism How's the Trustlines Blockchain different from Delegated Proof of Stake? Validator slots cannot be delegated; hence the Trustlines Blockchain does not support dPoS. Also, dPoS typically relies on social reputation systems, which is not the case for our approach. Validators \u00b6 What is a Trustlines validator? A Trustlines validator is a person or entity that has won a slot in the validator auction and is part of the active validator set of the Trustlines Blockchain. Initially, the Trustlines Blockchain will have a maximum of 55 validator slots, which will have one Trustlines validator per slot. The number of validators and validator slots may increase or decrease in the future according to what the Trustlines community decides. The validators have the responsibility of ensuring the security of the Trustlines Blockchain by validating transactions and adding blocks to the existing blockchain. They earn Trustlines Network Coins in the form of transaction fees and block rewards in this process. Additionally, Trustlines validators monitor the Trustlines bridge to ensure Trustlines Network Token to Trustlines Network Coin transfers and decide on blockchain forks and resulting protocol changes with the rest of the Trustlines ecosystem. To ensure that a Trustlines validator is able to fulfill their role, we suggest that a validator should meet the following criteria: Be technologically minded and able to run a Trustlines Blockchain node without a dedicated UI Have the necessary financial means to take part in the validator auction Understand the operational and legal risks associated with this activity Understand the responsibilities of being a Trustlines validator !!! question \"What are the requirements for becoming a Trustlines validator? Sign up with us to be a part of the Validator candidate set You'll get an email with more info and how to provide your Ethereum address to an independent third party You'll be whitelisted to take part in the validator auction Bid to stake TLN in the validator auction If you have secured a validator slot, you can run the Trustlines Blockchain node to validate and earn TLC. Why do you need my email and name if validators are anonymous? The Trustlines Foundation uses your email to notify you where you can whitelist an Ehereum address so that you may bid at the validator auction. Note that you do not need to use a personal email for this process and that the email addresses will be deleted afterward. We welcome that you use a throwaway email (see google throwaway email ), but note that the time at which you add your email and receive an email from the Trustlines Foundation can vary greatly (up to 9 months depending on when the next validator auction starts). Therefore, consider using an email you can access at a later point in time. How many Trustlines Network Coins will I earn? The initial block reward will be 3 TLC. Transaction fees added to the block vary. I'm not good at checking my email; how do I keep up? You can follow Trustlines Foundation on Twitter , subscribe to the Trustlines Blog or join the Trustlines Forum for more updates! I won a slot at the auction, and I'm a Trustlines validator. What now? Now you need to launch a Trustlines validator node. If you're unsure how to do this, start by familiarizing yourself with the process by watching the How to Install a Trustlines Node for Laika Testnet video . You can find the full documentation at the Trustlines Developer Docs . The Trustlines Foundation currently announces proposed forks on the Trustlines Forum , which you will need to familiarize yourself with. You can discuss the proposed forks and other governance topics on the Trustlines subreddit or any other forum that validators wish to use. What happens after nine months? Once the nine months have passed, validators can withdraw their stake provided it didn't get slashed due to equivocation. A new auction will be announced to find the next set of validator candidates. How technically savvy should I be to run a Trustlines node? You should know how to install a node and patch software updates regularly via your terminal. What happens if I win a slot, but I don't run a Trustlines node? You will fail to propose any blocks and will subsequently not earn any Trustlines Network Coins (TLC). After some time of inactivity, active validators would most likely propose a fork that would remove you from the validator set. Keep in mind that this will not negatively affect your TLN staked on Ethereum. It does mean that the staked amount will still remain locked until the end of the validation period. What happens if I won a slot, but the Trustlines Protocol fails/people lose interest? After the nine months have passed, you will still be able to reclaim your initial stake. Any other resources invested, such as paying for server uptime, will be your costs to bear, and you will not be able to ask for compensation. Please see the Terms and Conditions for details. Auction \u00b6 What is the Trustlines validator auction? The Trustlines validator auction is a Dutch auction held to discover the fair opportunity cost value, i.e., price of a validator slot. The Ethereum addresses of successful bidders in a successful auction will be included in the validator set. Acceptable tokens for a bid: The auction is a smart contract on the Ethereum mainchain. Note that the smart contract will not accept any other tokens than TLN as a bid. Participation: To be able to participate in the auction, your Ethereum address must have been whitelisted by the Trustlines Foundation prior to the start of the auction. Every whitelisted Ethereum address can participate in the auction only once. Timing: The auction ends at the earliest of two full calendar weeks starting from the start date or when the maximum threshold of bids is reached. Whichever comes first. Threshold: If less than the amount of minimum threshold of bids have been received at the time the auction ends, it will fail. No validator slots will be awarded, and all participants can withdraw their bids. Limited validator slots: Each nine month validator period has a limited amount validator slots available through an auction. How can I whitelist my Eth address to participate in the auction? Offline: To sign up offline, meet the Trustlines team in person at a meetup or conference. Follow us on Twitter to see when and where the next possibilities to sign up occur. Online: Use Proof-of-Sociality . Send a DM with your email address to @tl_validator on Twitter. Why should I be a Trustlines validator? The Trustlines Blockchain is a minimal viable Proof of Stake sidechain to Ethereum and is governed by a greenfield governance model. In this experimental consensus model, validators can gain technical and governance experience. Besides the technical validator capabilities mentioned above, validators will also receive block rewards (as to be defined within the chain spec, currently 3 TLC per block) in the form of Trustlines Network Coins. This only applies under the condition that they actively run their validator node and take part in block creation. They will also be in a position to charge transaction fees for transactions that are included within the blocks a validator creates. Note that receiving block rewards and transaction fees is dependent on a community of emerging validators and the potential users of the Trustlines Blockchain. The Trustlines Foundation cannot guarantee that a Trustlines Blockchain, including the chain spec as proposed by the Trustlines Foundation, actually emerges out of the actions of these third party stakeholders. Hence, participating in the auction and thereby agreeing to the Terms and Conditions does not entail a right or an entitlement in any way whatsoever to either becoming and/or remaining a validator or receiving block rewards and/or transaction fees. What happens when the auction ends? The slot price is defined as the last successful bid. This amount will be locked as your stake for nine months. Consequently, you will need to start your Trustlines Blockchain node with validator rights and begin proposing blocks. Any amount you bid above the final slot price can be withdrawn once the auction smart contract is set in a withdrawal state. Please see the auction page for further details. What are the risks of bidding at the auction? By participating in the auction, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks: Risk\u200b \u200bof\u200b \u200blosing\u200b a validator slot, TLN bid, or stake\u200b due\u200b \u200bto\u200b \u200bloss\u200b \u200bof\u200b private\u200b \u200bkey(s); Risks\u200b \u200bassociated\u200b \u200bwith\u200b \u200bthe\u200b \u200bEthereum\u200b blockchain: any malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of the Ethereum blockchain may have a material adverse effect on the smart contracts; Risk\u200b \u200bof\u200b \u200bmining\u200b \u200battacks: the auction smart contract is susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating bids on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the auction including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of bids; Risk\u200b \u200bof\u200b \u200bhacking\u200b \u200band\u200b \u200bsecurity\u200b \u200bweaknesses: hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the auction in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing; Risk\u200b \u200bof\u200b \u200buninsured\u200b \u200blosses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at financial institutions, the TLN held by the auction smart contract is uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by the Trustlines Foundation to offer recourse to you; Risks\u200b \u200bassociated\u200b \u200bwith\u200b \u200buncertain\u200b \u200bregulations\u200b \u200band\u200b \u200benforcement\u200b \u200bactions: the regulatory status of, including, but not limited to, the auction, the validator slots, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including but not limited to the auction and the validator slots. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the whole Trustlines Protocol in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, that some or all of the parties involved in the Trustlines Protocol, in general, might require licensing or is subject to existing legislation; Risks\u200b \u200barising\u200b \u200bfrom\u200b \u200btaxation; the tax characterization of acquiring a validator slot and/or acting as a validator is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with your partaking in the auction, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements. Unanticipated\u200b \u200brisks: blockchain technology and the Trustlines Protocol are new and untested technology. In addition to the risks referred to above, there are other risks associated with your partaking in the Trustlines auction, including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks previously referred to. Tokens \u00b6 Are you going to do an ICO? Trustlines Network Tokens are being distributed via a Merkle Drop to a wide range of recipients (see the Merkle Drop Launch blog post for more details). We will also consider other distribution models in the future. What will the block reward be? The initial block reward of the Trustlines Blockchain will be 3 Trustlines Network Coins (TLC) per block. Does Trustlines have tokens on Ethereum? Yes. The Trustlines Network Token (TLN) is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainchain. Do new users need to buy the Trustlines Network Token in order to join the Trustlines Blockchain? New users can choose to Use existing delegate services to pay transaction fees for them. The delegate services use the logic of meta transactions so that users do not need to pay for transactions in Trustlines Network Coins but can agree on other payments with the person or entity running such delegate services. Buy TLC on the market. Buy TLN on the market and transfer them to the Trustlines Blockchain. Who will receive tokens in the Merkle Drop? The Merkle drop aims to reach a broad audience covering early contributors, testers, developers, potential stakeholders, and, more generally, a wide audience from the crypto and community currency ecosystems. For the accessibility of Trustlines Network Tokens, the Foundation emphasized eligibility in groups that it sees as aligned with its mission. See the Merkle Drop Launch blog post for more details. Use cases and cooperation \u00b6 What is Trustlines People-Powered Money (PPM)? The Trustlines Network supports the creation of blockchain-based p2p currency networks. In dense societal networks and due to the transitive nature of financial relationships, one could imagine a plethora of financial use cases that employ these networks. Chief among them would be the ability to engage in economic transactions that could be viewed as a substitute for general payments of all kinds. This twist, i.e., the transition from a credit registry towards a system that could be used to facilitate payment-like transactions, is comparable to the principles of LETS-systems or, for example, the unofficial financial network \"Hawala.\" Read more in our People Powered Money on the Trustlines Protocol blog post . Which other use cases are there? The Trustlines Protocol is open-source and may be used to develop any use case by anyone. To be supported by the Trustlines Foundation, the use case must align with the Foundation's mission. Currently, some examples include Bill splitting and Time Credits with more to follow. I'm a fan of Trustlines; how can I contribute? Follow the Trustlines Foundation on Twitter , subscribe to the Trustlines Blog , or join the Trustlines Forum to stay updated with the latest news. You can also sign up to be a Trustlines validator candidate, contribute to the code on GitHub , or take part in governance discussions. I'm building a dapp and want to integrate the Trustlines Protocol. Where do I start? That's great! Feel free to let us know by reaching out to us . You can also start by going to the Trustlines Protocol Github and read any relevant documentation. You can ask any technical questions at the Trustlines Forum or on Gitter . Organizational \u00b6 What is the Trustlines Foundation's role? The Trustlines Foundation is supporting research, development, deployment, governance, and adoption of complementary currency systems, with a focus on open-source protocols designed to be utilized by decentralized p2p currency network designs. Is there a trademark on Trustlines? \"Trustlines\" and \"Trustlines Network\" are registered trademarks that are owned by the Trustlines Foundation. The purpose of the registration is to protect the usage of the terms \"Trustlines\" and \"Trustlines Network\" from inappropriate or malicious use. You can find the Trustlines Trademark Guidelines here in the Docs with information on how a party may use the \"Trustlines\" and \"Trustlines Network\" trademarks.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"resources/FAQ/#basics","text":"What's so special about Trustlines, and why use it? Through the Trustlines Protocol, Trustlines enables \"People Powered Money\" to be used by anyone anywhere. The Trustlines Protocol is an open-source technology stack that provides a highly usable medium of exchange. Its core idea is to provide an accounting system based on peer-to-peer credit. This is a remarkably accessible financial tool since any two people who trust each other can decide to open a credit line at any time, without typical restrictions like needing a bank account or identity documents. Credit is a powerful medium of exchange: Even if someone does not have access to the national currency (fiat money), this mutual credit could be used in its place. When designing a protocol for financial inclusion, it is essential to use accessible, decentralized technology. A feature of public blockchain technology is that they provide a permissionless and censorship-resistant platform. This is why Trustlines Protocol was designed to be implemented on a blockchain. The combination of an accessible medium of exchange and decentralized infrastructure makes Trustlines the starting point for a genuinely decentralized monetary system. What is a trustline? A trustline can be defined as a bilateral credit/trust relationship between individual people or entities. It encompasses two credit lines (each party giving one to the other party) as well as a balance which indicates if and how much credit one party has drawn from the other. What is a credit line? A credit line can be referred to as an (informal) agreement between two trusting users (e.g., friends), which allows one user to draw on credit given by the other. A credit line exists in the context of a currency network and, therefore, implicitly states the currency in which the accounting is done. What are IOUs (I Owe You)? An IOU is defined as an informal acknowledgment issued in a trustline from one party to the other. An IOU reduces the amount of credit available to one party and increases the amount of credit available to the other. During a transfer, outstanding IOUs are set-off before the credit of a credit line is drawn. Who controls the credit (IOU) flow? The two people who share a trustline control the flow of that trustline. When one person sends a payment request to another person, it is up to the receiver to accept or reject that credit. Your trustline credit balance can also change as a result of a multi-hop payment . This can happen if payments get rippled through you. This can not exceed a credit limit you have set for a trustline. What is a balance? The balance refers to the value of an IOU within a trustline. If the value is 0, no IOU has been issued. What is a multi-hop payment? A multi-hop payment refers to the mechanism used when multiple users in a currency network cooperate (implicitly as part of the agreement with the network) to facilitate a transfer between users that have no direct trustline agreement. The path encompasses all involved users and their trustlines. The IOU transfer is exclusively between the sender and receiver (who exchanged something of value to receive an IOU in one of their trustlines). What is a path? A path refers to the trustlines used between the sender and receiver during a multihop payment (see multihop payment). The path encompasses all involved users and their involved trustlines. Can anyone issue a credit line, trustline, or create a currency network?\" Yes. How do you use Trustlines?\" Users are presumed to make use of the Trustlines Protocol (see Trustlines Protocol ) with an application. Can I change the credit I have given my friends? Yes. You can update the amount of credit you want to trust your friend with at any point in time, except if your friend has already exceeded the new limit you want to set before you update it. Do I need to connect my bank account to my Trustlines account? / Is it planned to implement an option to transfer fiat money or crypto at some point? No. The Trustlines concept uses only credit between two trusting entities, and settling balances should only happen rarely. Currently, there is no way to connect any other payment protocols to your Trustlines account, but this could change in the future. These connected accounts would only be used in the case of settling or closing trustlines. How do I settle a trustline with a friend? Agree on the conditions in the real world (e.g., your friend pays you with money for the amount of credit he's drawn, or you exchange a good or service in return for settlement) Update the Trustline balance How can I be sure that I will get paid by the person I have a trustline with. Trustlines is based on the principle that you should only create trustlines with the people you actually know and trust. Thus there is no guarantee that you will be paid aside from your trusted relationship with a person. You can reduce the risks when setting up a credit limit. Set a maximum amount that you're willing to lend to someone. You can start with a small amount, and later you can increase the limit if needed. What happens if my friend won't pay me back (defaulting)? Nothing will happen in the system, and you can continue using Trustlines. You may have lost some real-world value, which is why you should only give trustlines to people you trust and in amounts that you're, in the worst case, willing to lose. How do you close a trustline? Reduce the balance of your trustline to 0. Once this is done, either party can close the trustline. Can friends change the credit I give them? No. The person giving the credit line always sets the amount of credit they're willing to provide. Even though users can request a credit change, any change needs to be accepted by the creator/giver of the credit. Can the Trustlines Foundation, or any other entity, close my trustlines, block or delete my account? This would depend on the currency network you had created the trustline in. All currency networks that the Trustlines Foundation would initially deploy are set up in a way that no other entity can close, block, or delete a user. Signing any transaction requires access to your private key, which nobody should have access to besides you. Please be sure that any application you use to interact with the Trustlines Blockchain does not give access to your private key to any third party. Can I leave currency networks? Yes. To leave, you need to close all your trustlines in a given currency network.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"resources/FAQ/#general","text":"What is the Trustlines Network?

Sign up with us to be a part of the Validator candidate set You'll get an email with more info and how to provide your Ethereum address to an independent third party You'll be whitelisted to take part in the validator auction Bid to stake TLN in the validator auction If you have secured a validator slot, you can run the Trustlines Blockchain node to validate and earn TLC. Why do you need my email and name if validators are anonymous? The Trustlines Foundation uses your email to notify you where you can whitelist an Ehereum address so that you may bid at the validator auction. Note that you do not need to use a personal email for this process and that the email addresses will be deleted afterward. We welcome that you use a throwaway email (see google throwaway email ), but note that the time at which you add your email and receive an email from the Trustlines Foundation can vary greatly (up to 9 months depending on when the next validator auction starts). Therefore, consider using an email you can access at a later point in time. How many Trustlines Network Coins will I earn? The initial block reward will be 3 TLC. Transaction fees added to the block vary. I'm not good at checking my email; how do I keep up? You can follow Trustlines Foundation on Twitter , subscribe to the Trustlines Blog or join the Trustlines Forum for more updates! I won a slot at the auction, and I'm a Trustlines validator. What now? Now you need to launch a Trustlines validator node. If you're unsure how to do this, start by familiarizing yourself with the process by watching the How to Install a Trustlines Node for Laika Testnet video . You can find the full documentation at the Trustlines Developer Docs . The Trustlines Foundation currently announces proposed forks on the Trustlines Forum , which you will need to familiarize yourself with. You can discuss the proposed forks and other governance topics on the Trustlines subreddit or any other forum that validators wish to use. What happens after nine months? Once the nine months have passed, validators can withdraw their stake provided it didn't get slashed due to equivocation. A new auction will be announced to find the next set of validator candidates. How technically savvy should I be to run a Trustlines node? You should know how to install a node and patch software updates regularly via your terminal. What happens if I win a slot, but I don't run a Trustlines node? You will fail to propose any blocks and will subsequently not earn any Trustlines Network Coins (TLC). After some time of inactivity, active validators would most likely propose a fork that would remove you from the validator set. Keep in mind that this will not negatively affect your TLN staked on Ethereum. It does mean that the staked amount will still remain locked until the end of the validation period. What happens if I won a slot, but the Trustlines Protocol fails/people lose interest? After the nine months have passed, you will still be able to reclaim your initial stake. Any other resources invested, such as paying for server uptime, will be your costs to bear, and you will not be able to ask for compensation. Please see the Terms and Conditions for details.","title":"Validators"},{"location":"resources/FAQ/#auction","text":"What is the Trustlines validator auction? The Trustlines validator auction is a Dutch auction held to discover the fair opportunity cost value, i.e., price of a validator slot. The Ethereum addresses of successful bidders in a successful auction will be included in the validator set. Acceptable tokens for a bid: The auction is a smart contract on the Ethereum mainchain. Note that the smart contract will not accept any other tokens than TLN as a bid. Participation: To be able to participate in the auction, your Ethereum address must have been whitelisted by the Trustlines Foundation prior to the start of the auction. Every whitelisted Ethereum address can participate in the auction only once. Timing: The auction ends at the earliest of two full calendar weeks starting from the start date or when the maximum threshold of bids is reached. Whichever comes first. Threshold: If less than the amount of minimum threshold of bids have been received at the time the auction ends, it will fail. No validator slots will be awarded, and all participants can withdraw their bids. Limited validator slots: Each nine month validator period has a limited amount validator slots available through an auction. How can I whitelist my Eth address to participate in the auction? Offline: To sign up offline, meet the Trustlines team in person at a meetup or conference. Follow us on Twitter to see when and where the next possibilities to sign up occur. Online: Use Proof-of-Sociality . Send a DM with your email address to @tl_validator on Twitter. Why should I be a Trustlines validator? The Trustlines Blockchain is a minimal viable Proof of Stake sidechain to Ethereum and is governed by a greenfield governance model. In this experimental consensus model, validators can gain technical and governance experience. Besides the technical validator capabilities mentioned above, validators will also receive block rewards (as to be defined within the chain spec, currently 3 TLC per block) in the form of Trustlines Network Coins. This only applies under the condition that they actively run their validator node and take part in block creation. They will also be in a position to charge transaction fees for transactions that are included within the blocks a validator creates. Note that receiving block rewards and transaction fees is dependent on a community of emerging validators and the potential users of the Trustlines Blockchain. The Trustlines Foundation cannot guarantee that a Trustlines Blockchain, including the chain spec as proposed by the Trustlines Foundation, actually emerges out of the actions of these third party stakeholders. Hence, participating in the auction and thereby agreeing to the Terms and Conditions does not entail a right or an entitlement in any way whatsoever to either becoming and/or remaining a validator or receiving block rewards and/or transaction fees. What happens when the auction ends? The slot price is defined as the last successful bid. This amount will be locked as your stake for nine months. Consequently, you will need to start your Trustlines Blockchain node with validator rights and begin proposing blocks. Any amount you bid above the final slot price can be withdrawn once the auction smart contract is set in a withdrawal state. Please see the auction page for further details. What are the risks of bidding at the auction? By participating in the auction, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks: Risk\u200b \u200bof\u200b \u200blosing\u200b a validator slot, TLN bid, or stake\u200b due\u200b \u200bto\u200b \u200bloss\u200b \u200bof\u200b private\u200b \u200bkey(s); Risks\u200b \u200bassociated\u200b \u200bwith\u200b \u200bthe\u200b \u200bEthereum\u200b blockchain: any malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of the Ethereum blockchain may have a material adverse effect on the smart contracts; Risk\u200b \u200bof\u200b \u200bmining\u200b \u200battacks: the auction smart contract is susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating bids on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks.

Trustlines Network Tokens are being distributed via a Merkle Drop to a wide range of recipients (see the Merkle Drop Launch blog post for more details). We will also consider other distribution models in the future. What will the block reward be? The initial block reward of the Trustlines Blockchain will be 3 Trustlines Network Coins (TLC) per block. Does Trustlines have tokens on Ethereum? Yes. The Trustlines Network Token (TLN) is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainchain. Do new users need to buy the Trustlines Network Token in order to join the Trustlines Blockchain? New users can choose to Use existing delegate services to pay transaction fees for them. The delegate services use the logic of meta transactions so that users do not need to pay for transactions in Trustlines Network Coins but can agree on other payments with the person or entity running such delegate services. Buy TLC on the market. Buy TLN on the market and transfer them to the Trustlines Blockchain. Who will receive tokens in the Merkle Drop? The Merkle drop aims to reach a broad audience covering early contributors, testers, developers, potential stakeholders, and, more generally, a wide audience from the crypto and community currency ecosystems.

The Trustlines Network supports the creation of blockchain-based p2p currency networks. In dense societal networks and due to the transitive nature of financial relationships, one could imagine a plethora of financial use cases that employ these networks. Chief among them would be the ability to engage in economic transactions that could be viewed as a substitute for general payments of all kinds. This twist, i.e., the transition from a credit registry towards a system that could be used to facilitate payment-like transactions, is comparable to the principles of LETS-systems or, for example, the unofficial financial network \"Hawala.\" Read more in our People Powered Money on the Trustlines Protocol blog post .

Use cases of the Trustlines Protocol \u00b6 As a fully open-source protocol, any individual or organization is free to develop use cases for the Trustlines Protocol. Currently, one of the more established and well-developed use cases is people-powered money. People Powered Money (PPM) \u00b6 The term \"People Powered Money\" is based on the EU Funded Community Currencies in Action (CCIA) research paper \" People Powered Money .\" The term is colloquially used to categorize various complementary currency initiatives throughout Europe and is therefore an umbrella term for multiple use cases. Though they vary in design, the currencies are all local, grassroots economic initiatives. Such initiatives belong to a distributed, world-wide group of projects and are also documented by economists such as Bernard Lietaer in the book \" People Money .\" Complementary/community/alternative currencies are \"people money.\" They are not necessarily a replacement for commercial bank money or government money. Instead, they are an entirely different type of money that can act in parallel to commercial and government money and may provide economic resilience when these systems fail. People Money in Design.

Overview \u00b6 The Trustlines Protocol is an open-source technology stack that provides a highly accessible medium of exchange. Its core idea is to provide an accounting system based on peer-to-peer credit. This is a highly accessible financial tool since any two people who trust each other can decide to open a credit line at any time, without typical restrictions like needing a bank account or identity documents. Credit is a powerful medium of exchange: Even if someone does not have access to national currency ( fiat money ), the credit created on Trustlines Protocol could be used in its place. When designing for financial inclusion, it is important to use accessible, decentralized technology. That is the goal of public blockchain technology: It can provide a permissionless and censorship-resistant platform. This is why Trustlines Protocol was designed to be implemented on a blockchain. There are many faults with the modern monetary system, in which the majority of money is created as debt by commercial banks. There are also weaknesses to using cryptocurrencies, which remain structurally inaccessible for most people. These can be mitigated by switching to a decentralized, credit-based monetary system, as is possible with the Trustlines Protocol. The combination of an accessible medium of exchange and decentralized infrastructure is what makes Trustlines the starting point for a truly decentralized monetary system. 2. Core idea \u00b6 2.1 How to pay with debt \u00b6 The term IOU ( an abbreviation for \"I owe you\") acknowledges that the issuing party has a debt towards the receiving party. Suppose Alice wants to buy something from Bob but cannot pay with cash or a bank transfer. Instead, she will acknowledge a debt towards him by issuing an IOU . Since Alice receives the goods and Bob receives an IOU , this transfer of debt is as good as a cash payment or bank transfer. But rather than having a claim towards his bank he now has a claim towards his trusted friend, Alice. IOUs can also be referred to as self-issued debt. They can be used for payment as long as users accept it. 2.2 What is a trustline ? \u00b6 A trustline is a bilateral credit relationship between two partners. Every trustline consists of two corresponding credit lines (each partner giving one to the other partner) as well as a balance that indicates if and how much credit one partner has drawn from the other. A trustline can represent different kinds of credit relationships, like a contract with or without collateral that is legally binding, or simply an agreement between friends. This makes a trustline a formal representation of a real world agreement between two entities that are willing to lend value to each other. This trustline enables Alice to make credit-based payments to Bob, and vice versa. 2.3 Credit lines \u00b6 A credit line is a preset borrowing limit (credit limit) that can be used at any time and represents the highest amount that can be borrowed. In this example, Alice and Bob each give a credit line with a credit limit of ten. Ten is the maximum amount each of them would be able to borrow from the other. 2.4 Multi-hop payment \u00b6 Even when two users do not have a trustline , they can still transfer value, as long as there is a path of trustlines connecting them. In a multi-hop payment , each user along the path of connected trustlines automatically sends credit to the next, until the last user receives credit. This process can also be referred to as rippling a payment. The net value transfer is always exclusively between the sender and receiver without the intermediaries needing to take any action. For example, Alice wants to pay Charlie using credit. Because Charlie does not share a trustline with Alice, she cannot directly pay him with credit. Luckily, Bob is a mutual friend! This means Alice can pay Charlie by \" rippling \" credit through Bob. Before the transfer, Bob's balance with Alice was zero. Bob's balance with Charlie was also zero. During the transfer, Bob's balance with Alice increased to \"plus five,\" while his balance with Charlie decreased to \"minus five.\" However, Bob's net balance remains unchanged at zero (-5+5=0). Because Bob is only an intermediary, this transaction happens automatically without Bob needing to take any action. 2.5 The network effect \u00b6 People that are not connected through a trustline can make multi-hop payments via any path of direct connected trustlines. Leveraging the network effect, users only need a small amount of trustlines to transact with a large number of people. This is clearer in the context of the six degrees of separation concept. The greater effect is that the rippled credit can be used as a medium of exchange in small, dense, circular economies. However, because it would naturally connect these small economies, it may equally serve as a medium of exchange for a global economy. Trustlines could turn existing trusted relationships into liquid payment networks that look and act like regular money. 2.6 Fault tolerance \u00b6 So, why not create fake accounts with \"fake credit\" to use in the network? This can't actually do much damage because the system relies on individual, trusted relationships. This is important to consider for designing scalable systems. For example, Eve created duplicate accounts to give herself millions in fake credit. But Eve's spending limit with the network is determined by the credit limit her friends have given her. In this example, Alice has given Eve a credit limit of ten. Because she knows Eve in real life and opening a Trustline needs the approval of both parties involved, Alice isn't going to create additional trustlines with the duplicate Eve accounts. Nor is she going to accept millions in credit from the real Eve. The system is naturally fault-tolerant because each trustline is bilateral. In other words, a trustline can affect only the two users who created it. Even if Eve manages to fool Alice, it will not affect the rest of the network. 2.7 Real-world enforcement of credit claims \u00b6 Because social norms affect informal enforceability , all users do have tangible social incentives to respect their obligations--whether or not there exists an external contract or collateral. Defaulting would have a negative impact on the user's social relationship with their trustline partner. It could also affect a user's reputation with the rest of the community. In case of a user not being able to pay back the obligation, there's also always the option to forgive the debt or settle in other ways than first anticipated. Payment from the creditor to the debtor would reflect this. As long as all trustlines and transactions are notarized on secure, auditable infrastructure, there can be a tamper-proof record of all credit agreements and their balances. This reduces the possibility of disputes. 2.8 Interoperable credit systems \u00b6 Although the system is naturally decentralized, it is possible to create layers of centralized systems on top of it. This is possible by creating organization accounts that create trustlines with their members based on accepted community rules. Creating such configurations of trustline relationships can serve the greater effect of \"socializing\" the risk of default within a defined group. The advantage to creating centralized systems using Trustlines is that these organizations would be inherently interoperable with other organizations, as well as with individuals, as long as all entities are connected in the network. A trustline can also be used to directly connect two organization accounts, which would connect groups using centralized methods. But because the network is based on individual trusted relationships, they do not need to do so in order to connect. Disparate communities using Trustlines will remain connected at the edges, wherever they are naturally interconnected by individual friends and families. This variety of possible credit configurations on Trustlines provide the flexibility to realistically represent real trust relationships in existing economies, and thus also naturally represent the boundaries between different communities. This is because natural economic borders would emerge between communities where there are fewer trusted relationships. 3. Protocol design choices \u00b6 3.1 Multiple currency networks \u00b6 The Trustlines Protocol was designed to be an open protocol on which several different denominations of trustlines coexist. Each denomination in which trustlines can be created is called a currency network . When a user creates a trustline , as long as there is enough capacity, anyone connected through a path can use it to facilitate multi-hop payments within the currency network . Users can participate in multiple currency networks . The purpose of having several different currency networks is to let communities use the currency design that best fits their needs. For example, users can pick currency networks according to their preferred denomination (the unit of account for recording transactions). Users can also opt-in to currency networks according to other parameters. For example, currency networks may enable or disable the ability to add interest. In future it will also be possible for users to convert or exchange between different currency networks . By default, currency networks are shared platforms, not controlled by a single party. Diverse communities are interoperable when they use the same currency network . There are 47 currency networks currently deployed on the Trustlines Blockchain which can be accessed through the Trustlines App , each defined by different parameters. 3.2 Open-source \u00b6 Trustlines Protocol was conceived as an open-source technology stack to encourage open collaboration, innovation, and transparency. When creating technology that is to be used as a public good, it is important to safeguard the intellectual property in this way, to ensure accessibility and to prevent it being used in an exploitative way. 3.3 Application ready \u00b6 Because accessibility is the goal, Trustlines was designed to be readily accessible from an application. For this we provide a set of tools (e.g. client library) that lets developers build their applications on top of the Trustlines Protocol. A reference implementation of such an application is the Trustlines App . It provides a first look at how mobile devices can serve as a gateway to this alternative financial system. 3.4 Censorship resistance through blockchain technology \u00b6 The Trustlines Protocol was designed to include an EVM-based blockchain, which is decentralized peer-to-peer technology. A blockchain is often referred to as \"trustless\" infrastructure which provides tamper-proof accounting, censorship-resistance, and relies on a decentralized governance of the system. Censorship-resistant public blockchains are designed with the goal that no hacker entity, corporation, or state can tamper with transactions, freeze accounts, or shut down the blockchain. They achieve this property because: the protocol and data is stored in a distributed way transactions are processed according to autonomous code pseudo-anonymous entities verify transactions This type of infrastructure is particularly important in parts of the world where stable, secure money can be difficult or dangerous to access. 3.5 Delegate service \u00b6 Cryptocurrencies are inconvenient and many times inaccessible for most people. In addition, a cryptocurrency must normally be purchased with national currency in order to interact with a blockchain. Because accessibility is the goal, Trustlines was designed to avoid placing such excessive burdens on the end user. However, since Trustlines is designed to be implemented on a public blockchain, making transactions requires the use of a native cryptocurrency to pay transaction fees. Acquiring this cryptocurrency to pay these fees would place a heavy burden on the end user. Instead, Trustlines delegates offer a service to pay transaction fees on behalf of end users. They may offer this for free in support of the community, or allow users to reimburse them using credit within an accepted Trustlines currency network . This can be useful for many different entities: Community groups that want to enable local economic activity, businesses that want to pay for the transactions of their customers, or simply third parties that want to encourage users to use Trustlines without them needing to deal with transaction costs. 4. Trustlines Protocol technology stack \u00b6 The full Trustlines Protocol technology stack is composed of four main components. These components are each a part of the Trustlines Protocol. Trustlines Protocol technology stack The Trustlines Blockchain, aka TLBC. A minimal viable Proof-of-Stake (mPoS) Ethereum sidechain. It stores and processes transactions. The relay servers. They are a bridge between applications and the blockchain. They offer services that are not feasible to implement on-chain or on devices on which applications run.

A high-level API which enables applications to interact with the smart contract system on the blockchain via the relay servers. 4.1 Trustlines Blockchain \u00b6 The Trustlines Blockchain, aka TLBC, is a minimal viable Proof-of-Stake (mPoS) Ethereum sidechain. Pseudo-anonymous validators run TLBC to ensure censorship-resistance. TLBC can adapt to changes required to ensure scalability, low transaction costs, and censorship-resistance. Its aim is to fulfill the following predefined requirements: Censorship-resistant Has the capacity to process up to 10 million trustline transfers per day Single transaction cost is less than \u20ac0.01 Features the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) which allows the operation of smart contracts The Trustlines Blockchain went live on November 21 st 2019. You can read more about the launch in the Launching the Trustlines Blockchain blog post . There is also a Blockchain Explorer for TLBC: https://explore.tlbc.trustlines.foundation/ . TLBC is based on Parity's Aura consensus algorithm . Aura (known from Kovan, xDAI, and others) is usually used in Proof-of-Authority chains. For our purposes of making it suitable for mPoS, we rely on the following additional features: Staking and slashing mechanisms to combat equivocation Hard-forking as an extra defense mechanism 4.1.1 Aura description Aura uses a predefined set of public authorities that fill in as validators. These authorities get assigned time slots in a round-robin fashion. They then produce a block that increases the blockchain length. Block finality is reached if more than 50% of validators build on top of the produced block. This relies on an honest and online majority assumption, as well as an asynchronous network. 4.1.2 mPoS (minimal viable Proof of Stake) In contrast to Proof-of-Authority blockchains, in the mPoS system, validators are pseudo-anonymous. Introducing pseudo-anonymous validators creates the need to ensure that no entity can get 51% of the voting power. Popular Proof of Stake chains with pseudo-anonymous validators, like Ethereum 2.0, can achieve this because it would be prohibitively expensive to buy 51% of the voting power. A new and unknown blockchain, such as the Trustlines Blockchain, cannot prevent a 51% attack the same way. To prevent this kind of attack, mPoS is designed to place additional restrictions on validators. These validators are defined through a validator auction . The participants of the auction need to be part of a whitelisted, Sybil-resistant set of candidates. Bids are made using Trustlines Network Token ( TLN ). At the end of the auction, TLN from winning bids are staked on the Ethereum blockchain for nine months. It is important that validators stake some amount of TLN , to prevent certain attacks. If validators misbehave, their stake can get \"slashed.\" In other words, the validator 's TLN deposit can be automatically rendered inaccessible. Under mPoS, staking and slashing features prevent validator equivocation. This is an attack in which a validator uses their private key to sign two or more different blocks with the same step number, irrespective of the block's height, validity, or other fields. Adding the mPoS features creates a consensus algorithm with sufficient safety measures for TLBC. 4.1.3 Hard-forking as an additional security option Pseudo-anonymous validators and mPoS features cannot ensure security from all attacks and threats. Such attacks and threats would include, but would not be limited to, inactive validators, reorganization of blocks by collusion, withholding blocks, building empty blocks, censoring transactions, or filling blocks with unusable information. Thus, as an additional defense mechanism, TLBC is intended to hard-fork to address these security risks and threats. Hard-forks are a simple, yet powerful way to remove misbehaving validators. They can also prevent other attack scenarios without slashing deposits of the validators. Since we expect a well-aligned community, we assume that coordination efforts around this will be manageable. Hard-forks should thus become reasonably easy to execute. Distribution of agreed-upon updates resulting in hard-forks can occur via updates and/or via a configuration file. The configuration file would be available at the Trustlines Protocol GitHub organization. The validators can then add the changed configuration into their clients/nodes. 4.2 Relay servers \u00b6 The relay servers act as a bridge between client applications and the Trustlines Blockchain. They offer services that aren't feasible to implement on-chain, or within the client applications or the devices they run on. Relay servers establish the main features needed to connect the users to the smart contract system: Forwarding users signed transactions from an application to the Trustlines Blockchain. Indexing and storing event information. Discovering a path between a sender and a receiver in the graph of trustlines by using Dijkstra's Algorithm . Taking into consideration the shortest path in the number of hops. Users do not need to trust relay servers with their accounts (private keys). Transactions are signed locally on the device. The signed transactions are then processed on the Trustlines Blockchain. The relay servers have the option to enable the delegation service which allows the operator to pay for connected users transaction costs. Using an existing relay server to send transactions to the Trustlines Blockchain is optional. It is possible for end users to calculate and specify their own paths or even use their own relay servers. In theory, the system could work without relay servers at all. However, this would significantly degrade the user experience. The pathfinding algorithm depends on knowing all available trustlines and a graph of the network. Doing pathfinding without a relay server would require the mobile app to sync the state of TLBC directly. Whenever this would take place, potentially millions of trustlines would need to be fetched from the blockchain. This would introduce significant latency and be a burden on the device the application is installed. It would lead to very intensive use of bandwidth, RAM. 4.3 Smart contract system \u00b6 The smart contract system is a collection of smart contracts deployed on TLBC. The smart contracts execute transfers within the Trustlines Protocol. All trustlines (i.e., credit lines and balances) are notarized on TLBC. The smart contracts also enforce the rules determining how trustlines can be created, used, and updated. The smart contract system is at the core of the Trustlines Protocol. It implements a secure, tamper-proof, decentralized, permissionless environment to host currency networks . 4.3.1 Currency networks The currency networks are the foundation of Trustlines. This is why they are implemented on-chain. These are the core smart contracts that end users interact with. The contracts record all properties a currency network has. This includes the symbol, the name, and the fee structure of the currency network . Trustlines are modeled as \"accounts\" within the currency networks . Included is also the account information: the users, their blockchain addresses, balances, and trustlines. Currency networks can be customized in various ways in addition to using different denominations (units of account). For example, they can be designed to restrict access, impose limits on interest rates. A currency network creator can specify conditions such as the maximum number of trustlines that a user can have the maximum value that a trustline can have whether interest can be added whether joining the network is open or permissioned 4.3.2 Identity contracts The identity contracts enable the delegate service, which allows end users to avoid paying their transaction costs with Trustlines Network Coins ( TLC ). This is a service offered by an entity that wishes to pay for the transactions of others, either for free or in exchange for credit within the given currency network . This feature can be useful for many different entities. For example, it may be community groups that want to enable local economic activity, businesses that want to pay for the transactions of their customers, or simply third parties that want to encourage users to use Trustlines without transaction costs. First, the user signs a message providing information about the trustlines transfer to be executed. The delegate then forwards a transaction containing this message and signature to an identity contract on the TLBC. By doing so, the delegate service pays for the transaction fees. The identity contract can then verify the signature provided by the user and execute its transfer concealed in the message. We use identity contracts as specified in Ethereum Improvement Proposals 1077 to implement delegates. 4.4 The client library \u00b6 The client library is a Javascript library that makes it easy to build applications on top of the Trustlines Protocol. It encapsulates application client functionalities in a ready-to-use way. It provides a high-level API enabling applications to interact with the smart contract system on TLBC via a relay server . 5. Cryptoeconomics of the Trustlines Protocol \u00b6 5.1 Tokens \u00b6 There are two different tokens used in connection with Trustlines: The Trustlines Network Token ( TLN ) The Trustlines Network Token ( TLN ) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainchain. Since this is a popular token standard, TLN is highly versatile, easily transferable, and generally very accessible for the Ethereum community. TLN is currently required for staking in the validator auctions for the Trustlines Blockchain. Trustlines Network Tokens ( TLN ) are distributed via a Merkle drop to a wide range of recipients. You can find more information about this in the Merkle Drop Launch blog post. The Trustlines Foundation will also consider other distribution models in the future. TLN can be converted into TLC via a bridge . No bridge exists for TLC to TLN conversion. The Trustlines Network Coin ( TLC ) The Trustlines Network Coin ( TLC ) is the native token of the Trustlines Blockchain, which means it is useful for people who are using the Trustlines Protocol in their everyday lives. Any user wanting to pay their own transaction fees must obtain TLC . TLC can be purchased directly, or instead users can buy TLN and convert it to TLC . Typically, it is the relay server operators that enable delegate services who use the most TLC . 5.2 Fees \u00b6 There are different fees necessary for the system to function correctly. Transaction fees are payable in TLC . All other fees are payable using credit within each currency network . End users do not need to hold TLC in order to pay any fees. 5.2.1 Trustlines Blockchain transaction fee (aka gas) This fee is payable in TLC and is required to pay for the \"gas\" used when the system processes any transaction, like for sending payments, as well as for creating new accounts or updating trustlines. The fee goes to the Trustlines validators. This fee is the predominant one and is typically paid by relay server operators. End users are not required to pay this fee directly (although they may do so if they wish). Instead, the typical end user will pay a delegate fee. 5.2.2 Delegate fee This fee is paid by the end user, who will pay this instead of paying the transaction fee directly. The delegate fee is payable in credit within a currency network , which makes it a better option for users who do not hold any TLC . The fee reimburses delegates for paying transaction costs on behalf of the end user. 5.2.3 Imbalance fee This is a fee that is paid to the mediators of a transfer. It can be paid by either the sender or receiver of a multi-hop payment . The fee is only applied if a multi-hop payment results in increased balances, rather than decreased balances. The purpose of this fee is to incentivize users to provide enough capacity for multi-hop payments, and to disincentivize users or relay operators from using payment paths that increase the imbalance of the network. 5.3 Interest \u00b6 In some currency networks , users may earn or pay interest on their credit if there is an imbalance (e.g., the other party owes them money) in a trustline . The accrued interest is calculated continuously. Currency networks can either have a network-wide interest rate, user-defined interest rates, or prohibit interest entirely. Network-wide interest rates result in every trustline having the same predefined interest rate (either negative or positive) applied to them. Within currency networks that have user-defined interest rates, each user has the option to set a custom interest rate on each of their individual credit lines. Both trustline partners must consent to the requested interest rates. Interest will continue to accrue as long as the trustline is open and has an imbalance. Note that interest can continue to accrue beyond a user's credit limit, and the total balance must be settled in order to close the trustline. 5.4 Validators on the Trustlines Blockchain \u00b6 A Trustlines validator is a person or entity that has won the validator auction and is part of the active validator set of the Trustlines Blockchain. The number of validators and validator slots may increase or decrease in the future according to what the Trustlines community decides. The validators have the responsibility of ensuring the security of the Trustlines Blockchain by validating transactions and adding blocks to the existing blockchain. They earn Trustlines Network Coins ( TLC ) from transaction fees and block rewards in this process. Additionally, Trustlines validators monitor the Trustlines bridge to ensure a Trustlines Network Token ( TLN ) to TLC transfer and decide on blockchain forks and resulting protocol changes with the rest of the Trustlines ecosystem. To ensure that each Trustlines validator is able to fulfill their role, we suggest that a Trustlines validator should meet the following criteria: Be able to run a Trustlines Blockchain node without a dedicated UI (some technical knowledge required) Have the necessary financial means to take part in the validator auction Understand the operational and legal risks associated with this activity Understand the responsibilities of being a Trustlines validator 5.4.1 Validator incentives The validators have the responsibility of ensuring the security of the Trustlines Blockchain by validating transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain. They earn TLC from transactions and as block rewards. 5.4.2 Token bridge The token bridge is a unidirectional bridge between the Ethereum blockchain and the Trustlines Blockchain. It is run by the Trustlines validators. It allows TLN holders to transfer these tokens to the Trustlines Blockchain in return for TLC . 5.4.3 Trustlines Blockchain governance Validators can also decide on blockchain forks and resulting protocol changes with the rest of the Trustlines ecosystem. After some time of inactivity, active validators will most likely propose a fork that would remove inactive validators from the active validator set. 5.4.4 Validator auction The Trustlines validator auction is a Dutch auction held every 9 months to discover the fair price of a validator slot. The Ethereum addresses of successful bidders in a successful auction will be included in the validator set. The validator slot price is defined as the last successful bid. This amount will be locked as each validator 's stake for nine months. Any validator who placed a bid above this final price can withdraw the difference at this point (after the auction smart contract reaches withdrawal state). After the conclusion of the auction , each validator will be able to start their Trustlines Blockchain node with validator rights and can begin proposing blocks. Acceptable tokens for a bid The validator auction takes place on a smart contract on the Ethereum mainchain. The smart contract will not accept any other tokens than TLN as a bid. Participation To be able to take part in the auction , your Ethereum address must have been whitelisted by the Trustlines Foundation before the start of the auction. Every whitelisted Ethereum address can participate in the auction only once.","title":"How Trustlines works"},{"location":"resources/wp_content/how_trustlines_works/#1-overview","text":"The Trustlines Protocol is an open-source technology stack that provides a highly accessible medium of exchange. Its core idea is to provide an accounting system based on peer-to-peer credit. This is a highly accessible financial tool since any two people who trust each other can decide to open a credit line at any time, without typical restrictions like needing a bank account or identity documents. Credit is a powerful medium of exchange: Even if someone does not have access to national currency ( fiat money ), the credit created on Trustlines Protocol could be used in its place. When designing for financial inclusion, it is important to use accessible, decentralized technology. That is the goal of public blockchain technology: It can provide a permissionless and censorship-resistant platform. This is why Trustlines Protocol was designed to be implemented on a blockchain. There are many faults with the modern monetary system, in which the majority of money is created as debt by commercial banks. There are also weaknesses to using cryptocurrencies, which remain structurally inaccessible for most people. These can be mitigated by switching to a decentralized, credit-based monetary system, as is possible with the Trustlines Protocol. The combination of an accessible medium of exchange and decentralized infrastructure is what makes Trustlines the starting point for a truly decentralized monetary system.","title":"1.

This process can also be referred to as rippling a payment. The net value transfer is always exclusively between the sender and receiver without the intermediaries needing to take any action. For example, Alice wants to pay Charlie using credit. Because Charlie does not share a trustline with Alice, she cannot directly pay him with credit. Luckily, Bob is a mutual friend! This means Alice can pay Charlie by \" rippling \" credit through Bob. Before the transfer, Bob's balance with Alice was zero. Bob's balance with Charlie was also zero. During the transfer, Bob's balance with Alice increased to \"plus five,\" while his balance with Charlie decreased to \"minus five.\" However, Bob's net balance remains unchanged at zero (-5+5=0).

The greater effect is that the rippled credit can be used as a medium of exchange in small, dense, circular economies.

This can't actually do much damage because the system relies on individual, trusted relationships. This is important to consider for designing scalable systems. For example, Eve created duplicate accounts to give herself millions in fake credit. But Eve's spending limit with the network is determined by the credit limit her friends have given her. In this example, Alice has given Eve a credit limit of ten. Because she knows Eve in real life and opening a Trustline needs the approval of both parties involved, Alice isn't going to create additional trustlines with the duplicate Eve accounts. Nor is she going to accept millions in credit from the real Eve. The system is naturally fault-tolerant because each trustline is bilateral. In other words, a trustline can affect only the two users who created it.

In case of a user not being able to pay back the obligation, there's also always the option to forgive the debt or settle in other ways than first anticipated. Payment from the creditor to the debtor would reflect this.

The advantage to creating centralized systems using Trustlines is that these organizations would be inherently interoperable with other organizations, as well as with individuals, as long as all entities are connected in the network. A trustline can also be used to directly connect two organization accounts, which would connect groups using centralized methods. But because the network is based on individual trusted relationships, they do not need to do so in order to connect. Disparate communities using Trustlines will remain connected at the edges, wherever they are naturally interconnected by individual friends and families. This variety of possible credit configurations on Trustlines provide the flexibility to realistically represent real trust relationships in existing economies, and thus also naturally represent the boundaries between different communities.

To ensure that each Trustlines validator is able to fulfill their role, we suggest that a Trustlines validator should meet the following criteria: Be able to run a Trustlines Blockchain node without a dedicated UI (some technical knowledge required) Have the necessary financial means to take part in the validator auction Understand the operational and legal risks associated with this activity Understand the responsibilities of being a Trustlines validator","title":"5.4 Validators on the Trustlines Blockchain"},{"location":"resources/wp_content/use_in_the_real_world/","text":"Disclaimer Please note, that even though we do our best to ensure the quality and accuracy of the information provided, this publication may contain views and opinions, errors and omissions for which the content creator(s) and any represented organization cannot be held liable. The wording and concepts regarding financial terminology (e.g. \u201cmoney\u201d, \u201cpayments\u201d, \u201c IOU \u201d, \u201ccurrency\u201d, \u201ccredit\u201d, \u201cdebt\u201d, \u201ctransfer\u201d [of value]) are exclusively used in an exemplary way to describe technological principles and do not necessarily conform to the real world or legal equivalents of these terms and concepts. In the following section, we give a brief description of how the Trustlines Protocol can be used for different purposes or communities. Bill Splitting \u00b6 Using Trustlines creates a nicer environment for splitting bills, since users rarely have to settle with cash. When splitting the bill at a restaurant or for similar group activities, settling in cash can be problematic. Using Trustlines helps create a nicer environment for recording debts between friends and acquaintances. If you go out with your friends often, these payments will go back and forth for a long time, which can make it wholly unnecessary to settle with cash or bank transfer. Because of the \" network effect, \" using Trustlines also allows you to avoid handling cash even with people beyond your immediate circle of friends. For example, suppose a new acquaintance Alice pays a restaurant $10 for your lunch, and meanwhile, your mutual friend Bob owes you $10. You can \"pay\" Alice back by simply transferring Bob's debt to Alice. This transfer of credit occurs automatically via \" multi-hop payments \" on Trustlines. The People's ATM \u00b6 Trustlines users can withdraw cash from any other connected Trustlines user, reducing dependency on ATMs. Trustlines can be used as a way to access cash without an ATM, by enabling you to get it from individuals in the Trustlines network instead. This works because credit on Trustlines is very similar to how a bank deposit works. The money in your bank account does not actually represent cash stored in a vault. Instead, it is a record of the debt the bank owes you. When you withdraw cash at an ATM, this simply reduces that debt. Similarly, when \"withdrawing\" cash from an individual in the Trustlines network, this simply reduces your net balance. The same mechanism can be used to make deposits. For example, to make a withdrawal, you would send a payment in IOUs (an abbreviation for \"I owe you\") over Trustlines to the connected individual. This individual would then give you that sum in cash. To make a deposit, you would request a payment over Trustlines from the connected individual. Upon receipt, you would give them that sum in cash. In order to successfully use the People's ATM, there must be consensus among your connections that debts in Trustlines may be exchanged for cash on demand. Due to the network effect , using Trustlines would enable users to withdraw or deposit cash from any connected person or entity in the currency network . Time Credits \u00b6 A Trustlines currency network can use \"time\" as its unit of account, enabling a decentralized, interoperable network of timebank communities. Time credits (also referred to as time dollars or timebanking) are a popular form of alternative currency. They usually emphasize a circular economy in which every individual has something both to give and to receive. A Trustlines currency network can be customized for time credits by using \"time\" or \"work hours\" as its unit of account. In order to do this, debits and credits can simply be denominated in HOURS. Instead of a central authority issuing an arbitrary number of time dollars, using Trustlines would allow credit to be organically issued by trusted community members whenever it is needed. With Trustlines, communities have the option to mirror the structure of existing timebanks by using an organization account. The advantage to doing so is that any timebank on Trustlines would be interoperable with other timebanking communities, as well as with individuals that use the same currency network (with time as a unit of account). Note that time is a universal unit of account. Thus, any currency network using \"time\" as its denomination has the potential to be used as a globally interoperable or \"glocal\" monetary system. Gift Vouchers \u00b6 Creating gift vouchers on Trustlines would exponentially expand their reach, since anyone connected in the network can access them. Many small businesses are in crisis due to the global pandemic. Some restaurants and other businesses are relying on gift cards and vouchers to stay afloat. Trustlines is a great way to manage a gift voucher program. Using Trustlines allows for a large-scale, interoperable network of gift vouchers. This network would respect the self-governing nature of independent businesses and allow a cheap and transparent mechanism for issuing virtual vouchers to customers. The businesses would retain the flexibility to charge their customers via whichever payment method they prefer, or to give them out for free. The network effect would exponentially expand the reach of the vouchers, since anyone connected in the Trustlines network would be able to access them. For example, if a customer buys a voucher with a restaurant, but doesn't use it fast enough, someone connected by a path of trustlines could use it instead. This is great for businesses, as it expands the reach of the vouchers. It also has an advantage for the customers, who feel secure knowing their vouchers are less likely to go unused, and may therefore be more willing to buy them. Businesses can also choose to partner with other businesses by opening trustlines between each other. This would be like agreeing that Business A's vouchers will be redeemable with Business B, and vice versa. This would combine both businesses' customer networks, expanding the reach of both A and B vouchers. Microcredit \u00b6 Trustlines makes it easy to create and access microcredit securely, which can help to fight poverty. Microcredit is the term used for loans consisting of relatively small amounts of money. Access to microcredit helps fight poverty and supports financial inclusion. Trustlines makes it easy to create and access microcredit securely. To engage in microcredit, the borrower would make a payment in IOUs over Trustlines to the lender. The lender would then pay out a sum in cash or bank transfer. Microloans in existing currency networks have no time limit, so lenders and borrowers currently need to set their own term agreements externally. Examples of microlending platforms that could be built on Trustlines include services like Kiva . Credit created over a trustline can have a positive interest if both trustline partners agree to these conditions. However, adding interest is an optional feature. Positive interest can help increase the risk appetite of users. Users might be more willing to give a credit line , or trust each other with higher credit limits, with the possibility to add interest. Enabling this option can thus increase the liquidity of the network. On the other side of microcredit is microsavings . Trustlines also makes it easy for users to offer microloans, and securely save money with their peers. An example of peer-to-peer microcredit and microsavings would be the ROSCA model. Community Currency \u00b6 Using Trustlines for a community currency can enhance or influence spending within the community. Local or community currency projects seek to enhance spending within the community, or to influence community spending patterns. Such projects can use the Trustlines Protocol in a few different ways. One way to use Trustlines for a community currency is to use a local or custom unit of account, to emphasize unity and strengthen the local economy. This can be done by opting into a local currency network , or by launching a custom currency network . Launching a custom currency network allows communities to change other features, such as using a permissioned network. Because Trustlines Protocol is open-source, communities may choose to further tailor the feature set provided to reflect their needs or to deploy an existing solution on the Trustlines Blockchain. This means higher potential for interoperability with similar community currency projects in the ecosystem. Note that Trustlines was designed to enhance local community trade, since it creates high levels of liquidity within dense social networks. Users would tend to have more trustlines, and higher credit limits, within their local trusted communities. This effect may encourage hyper-local trading circles within community currencies. Circular Economy \u00b6 Trustlines is the ideal tool for payments in a circular economy, and its use can boost sustainability and economic resilience. It is possible to use Trustlines to encourage circular economic activity by placing additional restrictions on how value leaves the system, by using community guidelines or a \"social contract.\" This can strengthen local economies and support sustainable business practices. One way to do this is if community members agree to disallow settling debts in cash or bank transfer. Instead, they may follow guidelines to use Trustlines payments only for directly transacting within the local market. In other words, anyone with money to spend within Trustlines would have to buy local. This helps encourage community members to seek out latent productivity within their community, and to reinforce sustainable economic loops in the market. The effect would be similar to using a non-convertible currency . A similar approach would be to allow settling of debts with national currency, but only at a discount. For example, consider BerkShares , a local community currency in Massachusetts. BerkShares are designed so that the user takes a 5% loss if converting the currency into U.S. dollars. This incentivizes users to keep using BerkShares by buying locally. Note that by default, any guidelines restricting the use of national currency must enter the community via a \"social contract.\" In other words, each individual community member (or perhaps each individual trustline partnership) must make a commitment to comply with such guidelines. Because a mature Trustlines network will mean that communities can always fall back on credit-based payments when short on cash, building up strong circular payment networks in this way could be very important. Trustlines could become a counter-cyclical complement to fiat money, offering greater resilience to economic crises. Glocal Monetary System \u00b6 Trustlines can be a superior alternative to the global monetary system, since it is globally scalable yet has all the benefits of local currencies. One vision for Trustlines is to use peer-to-peer (P2P) credit as an alternative type of global monetary system. There are several potential economic and social benefits of moving away from existing monetary systems, and instead, moving towards a type of money issued by its users. The idea of using P2P credit as a monetary system could result in a counter-cyclical complement to fiat money, facilitating local trade even in the face of a money shortage, which in turn would offer resilience to economic crises. However, some may go further and view it as an alternative to the commercial bank money monopoly. If the unit of account within a Trustlines currency network is a global currency, this allows for local economies using it to remain mostly regional yet still interoperable. This is because natural trade boundaries are determined by the extent of the trusted connections (i.e., more trustlines and higher credit limits) existing between communities. In this way, Trustlines can act like a \"glocal\" currency, having both benefits of a local community currency and an interoperable, global monetary system. Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) \u00b6 Traditional LETS systems can be implemented on Trustlines, to benefit from interoperability with the rest of the network. Higher-order or \"centralized\" entities can arise on top of decentralized currency networks . The advantage to this is that credit risk can be socialized within a group, to mirror the popular Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) model. This is an accounting system that allows community members to exchange goods and services without using the national currency, simply by recording transactions and the resulting member balances on a centralized ledger. The LETS model is used in more than 1500 communities worldwide. With Trustlines, a LETS group can open an organization account and create identical trustlines with all its members (using its preferred currency network ). Organization accounts could be controlled by a single trusted individual or a group of people. Such a setup in Trustlines would socialize the credit risk: Unpaid debts would equally impact all members of the organization. Such a configuration would help increase liquidity within the community. Due to the network effect , building a LETS community on top of Trustlines means it would remain implicitly interoperable with different communities and individuals using the same currency network . Trade Exchange Network \u00b6 Businesses may use Trustlines to establish a decentralized B2B trade exchange, also benefiting from interoperability with the P2P network. Businesses may use Trustlines to establish a business-to-business (B2B) trade exchange, also called a barter network. Similar to a P2P network, in which trustlines are issued amongst friends, a B2B network occurs when businesses create trustlines with other businesses. This type of arrangement can even be considered its own type of money, \"B2B money.\" Unlike traditional trade exchanges, using Trustlines would allow such a system to be fully decentralized. There is a significant advantage to building such a system on top of Trustlines: It will remain interoperable with any P2P trustlines within the same currency network . Possible examples of trade exchange networks include the WIR Bank in Switzerland and Sardex in Italy. Degrowth Money \u00b6 A Trustlines currency network can implement a negative interest rate, to discourage hoarding and facilitate degrowth. Trustlines was designed so that currency networks can include \"demurrage,\" i.e., negative interest. Negative interest can help discourage hoarding since all balances lose value over time. Demurrage money can be considered a type of Degrowth Money : \"Making money alive through demurrage means that money will also gradually die when not in use. Degrowth money allows us to limit the extent to which accumulation can take place in the system and instead foster circulation and exchange within the values of the commons. Like this, both the issuance and the decay of money take place constantly and adapt to the seasonal needs of people who govern it, following the principles of the commons outlined by \u00d6strom and others,\" (Linares and Caba\u00f1a, 2020). The advantage to using Trustlines to launch a currency with negative interest is that it would retain all of the compelling properties of any Trustlines currency network , e.g., it would be highly accessible and decentralized, in addition to facilitating degrowth. Examples of demurrage systems include the Chiemgauer , a regional currency in Germany. Universal Basic Income \u00b6 A Trustlines currency network can be a decentralized distribution system for universal basic income. It is difficult to distribute a universal basic income when people do not have access to bank accounts or the necessary identity documents. Trustlines doesn't require either of them, which solves the problem and allows communities to create credit that may be spent like a basic income. Normally, user balances in Trustlines swing back and forth between positive and negative amounts. On a technical level, the amount of the basic income would correspond to a predefined limit on each user's net \"negative\" balance. In principle, this can work the same way as when using peer-to-peer (P2P) credit as a \"glocal\" monetary system . The difference is that members should extend trustlines to anyone who can prove they are a real human being, using only one account. This is in contrast to the default version of Trustlines, in which members create trustlines with those who are trusted to pay back their debts, regardless of whether someone may be handling multiple accounts. The fault-tolerance of Trustlines implicitly limits the basic income to one-per-person. This is because each person must judge for themselves whether to trust the \"personhood\" of their friends' accounts. If they trust wrongly, they risk holding credit from a duplicate account (also called a Sybil account), and thus cannot spend this credit with the rest of the community. Collateralized Credit \u00b6 Although collateral is not necessary to use Trustlines, any user can decide to add collateral to boost trust and trade. Trustlines is designed so that anyone may issue credit without needing financial collateral. However, it is possible for users or communities to secure the credit they issue with collateral, if that is desired. This can be accomplished effectively with a contract or a legal agreement. In the future, it may be possible to do this via smart contract technology, if users need to manage the collateral in a transparent and trustless way. Using collateral makes it possible for credit from specific organizations to be \"backed\" by local government or private entities, depending on the situation. For example, a local municipality may want to bootstrap the local Trustlines community by guaranteeing the credit from a set of vetted, eco-friendly businesses. This would make it possible for a larger number of businesses and individuals to securely give credit lines to eco-friendly businesses, improving network liquidity and boosting trade. It is up to the users to decide whether to issue such collateral in full or in part, or according to some dynamic formula.\\ An example of a partially collateralized credit model would be BerkShares , a local community currency in Massachusetts that is backed by U.S. dollar reserves.","title":"Use in the real world"},{"location":"resources/wp_content/use_in_the_real_world/#bill-splitting","text":"Using Trustlines creates a nicer environment for splitting bills, since users rarely have to settle with cash.

One advantage of using Trustlines is that it also allows you to avoid handling cash even with people beyond your immediate circle of friends, by automatically moving around the credit in your network. For example, if your acquaintance Alice pays a restaurant $10 for your lunch, and your mutual friend Bob owes you $10, you can \"pay\" Alice back by simply transferring Bob's debt to Alice. This transfer of credit occurs automatically during \"multi-hop payments\" on Trustlines. Before you can use Trustlines for payments, you first need to create some trustlines with your trusted friends. You can create trustlines even with those you don't plan to transact with often, increasing the extended network of people with whom you can transact. Higher credit limits on your trustlines will allow you to send larger payments. See the User Guide for instructions about opening trustlines. Why use Trustlines for bill splitting \u00b6 Traditional apps for bill splitting usually encourage quick settlement, often compelling users to connect a bank account or create an account with the service provider. These apps allow users to accumulate debt with friends, but they assume users will settle these debts directly via cash or bank transfer. They do not provide a general accounting system in which users can instead take advantage of credit clearing within the complete network of users , without necessarily settling in cash . As money circulates in an economy, most debts should naturally cancel out over time. This is why it makes sense to use an accounting system like Trustlines for tracking debts, without the need for immediate settlement. An accounting system that clears credit automatically will reduce the frequency of needing to settle, and can even make settling wholly unnecessary. Furthermore, since Trustlines is highly secure, it does not require any intermediaries (like banks). Users can trust the ledger to keep good records, and do not need to connect an external bank account since no \"real money\" is transferred until users decide to settle. In addition, unlike typical bill splitting apps, Trustlines can be used with people outside the user's immediate circle of friends, or even with complete strangers. Strangers do not ordinarily trust each other with unsecured debt, so in most payment scenarios, people are obliged to use national currency. For example, most people rely on cash, bank cards, or traditional payment apps like PayPal or Venmo. But Trustlines allows users to avoid handling national currency and use credit instead, by rippling debts through friends-of-friends in the same currency network. This means you can use Trustlines to split the bill with people you don't know very well, without worrying about getting your money back\u2014since you will always end up holding credit directly with the people you trust. If you use Trustlines, you could potentially transact with credit in any scenario, and never have to connect a bank account. The following section will provide some illustrative examples of how Trustlines may be used for bill splitting. Split the groceries with roommates \u00b6 Today it's Nica's turn to go shopping for groceries to share with her roommates, Mallory and Janine. Both Mallory and Janine have trustlines with Nica. The groceries cost $30, and Nica pays this with her debit card. She will need to ask her roommates for $10 each in order to split the cost evenly. It doesn't make sense to demand cash from her roommates right now because Nica knows that next week they will do the grocery shopping, and she will have to pay them back. Instead, she decides to hold credit from each roommate. In other words, she'd like each roommate to make a promise that they owe her ten dollars. To record these promises, she shares an electronic payment request for ten dollars with each of her roommates. She makes sure to add a note to the payment request explaining that it's for this week's groceries. Soon after she sends these requests, each of her roommates receives a notification on their mobile phone. They each fulfill Nica's payment request by sending credit for ten dollars, using Trustlines. None of them have to handle any cash during this process. If Nica checks her balances, she'll notice that her balance with each roommate is $10. (If Mallory or Janine check their balances, they will each see it is -$10.) Split a meal with trusted friends \u00b6 Mallory, Nica, and Phil all work in the same office and often hang out together. Mallory has trustlines with both Nica and Phil. After work, the three of them go out to dinner together. The meal costs $30. Mallory offers to pay the restaurant bill with her debit card, and her friends agree to pay her $10 each. But it doesn't make sense for Mallory to demand cash from her friends right now, because she trusts them to pay the next time they go out together. Instead, Nica and Phil can each make a promise to Mallory that they owe her ten dollars. To keep track of these promises, Mallory creates a payment request for ten dollars and shares this with Nica and with Phil. Nica and Phil each scan the request, and each of them sends ten dollars in credit to Mallory. Remember that Mallory already owes Nica $10 from splitting the groceries. When Nica sends $10 in credit to Mallory, this debt is simply canceled out. If Mallory checks her balance with Nica after the transaction, she will notice that it has returned to zero. Split a meal with people you don't know well \u00b6 Later that week, Phil goes out for lunch at a restaurant with two other people from his office, Nica and Samir. They are all using Trustlines, but none of them know Phil well enough to have direct trustlines with him. The meal costs $30. Phil offers to pay the restaurant bill with his debit card, and his colleagues agree to pay him back $10 each. Because Phil knows that he will probably go out for lunch with other colleagues again in the future, he'd rather have credit instead of cash. Even though neither Nica nor Samir has trustlines with him, meaning they can't send him credit directly, they want to check if they are connected through their network and able to send credit with a multi-hop payment. If they're all connected through trustlines with mutual friends, like Mallory and Ryan, it should be possible for each of them to transfer credit to Phil through a multi-hop payment. (Note that each trustline along the payment path must have enough credit capacity for the entire transferred amount\u2014it won't work if someone along the way has \"maxed out\" their credit already.) So Phil shares a payment request for ten dollars. Nica and Samir each scan the request, and automatically see a confirmation that they are connected and have enough capacity in their trustlines to fulfill the payment. Next, they each send him credit for ten dollars through a multi-hop payment. If Phil checks his balances after the transaction, he'll notice that he is now owed credit only from people with whom he has a direct trustline. His balance with Ryan is now $10, since Samir rippled a payment through Ryan. (The rippling happened automatically, without Ryan needing to take action. If Ryan decided to check his balances now, he would notice that Samir now owes him $10.) Also, remember that Phil previously owed Mallory $10 from dinner. When he checks his balance with Mallory, he notices that it has returned to zero. This is because Nica rippled a payment of $10 through Mallory, canceling out this debt. (The rippling happened automatically, without Mallory needing to take action. If Mallory decided to check her balances now, she would notice that Nica now owes her $10.) People powered money \u00b6 Using Trustlines in your everyday transactions can add simplicity to your life, but it also has larger societal benefits. Even if you're just using Trustlines to split bills, you're implicitly using an ancient and radical type of money and an alternative to the traditional financial system, People Powered Money. Each new trustline is a contribution to the creation of a sustainable and egalitarian monetary system. That is because when you create new trustlines, you're growing the network and making it more useful for others, too.","title":"Bill splitting on Trustlines"},{"location":"use_cases/bill_splitting/bill_splitting_on_trustlines/#why-use-trustlines-for-bill-splitting","text":"Traditional apps for bill splitting usually encourage quick settlement, often compelling users to connect a bank account or create an account with the service provider.

Community groups can facilitate direct transfers of value between members by providing a trusted intermediary. This is useful when the two individuals are strangers and are not willing to create a trustline.

Community groups can partner with other trusted organizations, to facilitate direct transfers of value between members of their different communities. This is useful when people do not share direct trustlines. Community partnerships also expand both networks of partner businesses, thus growing the \"spend\" network of all volunteers.

This information is based on the capacity of the received credit limits. Using Trustlines would result in a transparent, public source of data to track the scope and impact of community work. Such transparency will be important in shaping future policy decisions) Time credits and the circular economy \u00b6 In the non-profit sector, there is an often-overlooked but important distinction between charity work and solidarity work . Using the term \"solidarity\" usually indicates a belief that community work is a reciprocal or circular activity. Proponents emphasize that we each have something to both contribute and to gain from our neighbors, that no person is an island. This philosophy is apparent in most time credit systems. Time credits (also referred to as time dollars or timebanking) are a form of alternative currency in which the unit of account is \"time.\" In other words, they receive a number of credits corresponding to the number of hours worked. See Top 3 reasons to use time credits for community work for some benefits of time credits. Within most time credit systems, it is generally accepted that everybody's time should be valued equally. This may be due to an egalitarian philosophy, but also related to the specific type of work being done. \"Care work\" is an example of a specific type of work that is not typically valued by the market economy, but it can be a good fit for time credits. Under a system of time credits, beneficiaries of community services should not feel as if they are receiving charity. This is because the beneficiaries, too, have value to contribute. They typically expect to \"pay it forward\" in the future. Likewise, those contributing their time and services expect to be beneficiaries of the system, at some point. Top 3 reasons to use time credits for community work Reward volunteers for community work. This may help reduce burnout and sustain existing levels of community work, in addition to attracting broader participation. Empower recipients of services to view themselves as assets, with something to contribute to the community. Access untapped potential. Empower recipients of volunteer services to show tangible appreciation by giving credits to volunteers. This is particularly important for those who do not have the financial means to do so otherwise. Compatibilities: mutual credit and time credits \u00b6 Under a system of mutual credit, all value exchanges are simply debits and credits between entities that trust each other. One reason this works is due to value circulating evenly: Every member of the credit clearing system should be comfortable \"lending\" into the system because they know the value will eventually be repaid in another form. It is straightforward to implement a time credit system using mutual credit because both assume a circular economy. All debits and credits are simply denominated in \"time\" as the unit of account. Instead of a central authority issuing an arbitrary number of time dollars, mutual credit would allow units of value to be organically issued by trusted community members whenever they are needed. Scalability problems in centralized time credit systems \u00b6 Because of the trust involved in creating an alternative economy, it is difficult for centralized systems to grow beyond the natural borders of a trusted community (in which the members really know each other). There are a few reasons for this: A small community creates a more intimate environment, which motivates people to look after their neighbors. If it gets too big, people may start to feel alienated from the community. This can make people feel less motivated to contribute. People are more trusting when the community consists of friends or friends-of-friends, so members can hold each other accountable. In a large community, people may lose faith that others will honor the value of their credits. These problems of scalability are easily avoided when using Trustlines. But Trustlines still preserves all the advantages of centralized systems. Similar centralized configurations can be created using Trustlines.

This document is not comprehensive. It is meant to guide and inspire. This diagram shows how different entities using time credits are naturally interconnected through Trustlines.

Boxes represent communities in which each member has a trustline with the organization account. Characters with a round border are managers of an organization account. Anyone can ripple a transaction to anyone else in the network, as long as each connecting trustline has enough capacity. 1. Decentralized Timebank \u00b6 The easiest way to start using time credits is to join the decentralized timebank. Group clusters will occur around geographic areas or according to interest groups. For example, several individuals may want to start using time credits in the Berlin area. Scenario 1: Decentralized Timebank Individuals can start using time credits independently, with anyone they trust. By doing so, they join the \"decentralized timebank.\" How to integrate with Trustlines Several people in Berlin become interested in the idea of timebanking and want to try it out. Some of them know each other from the neighborhood, and others share a coworking space. Others are just good friends. All of these connections are the basis for different trust relationships: Each person individually opens a trustline with the people they trust. Most people agree that five hours is a reasonable mutual credit limit for regular acquaintances. Andy and Sam are neighbors. They open a trustline with each other because Sam has children, and Andy babysits once a week. Also, Sam has a car, and Andy sometimes needs a ride. They transact with each other often, so they set a mutual credit limit of ten. Even though it's just the two of them, being able to track these exchanges using time credits has made the value of their services more visible, and mutually enriched their lives. Andy and Sam have a trustline. Andy pays Sam for giving him a ride. Sam pays Andy for babysitting. But it's not just Andy and Sam. Dana, a gardener, is a good friend of Andy's. They decide to open a trustline with a mutual credit limit of five. Even though Andy and Dana may not directly have skills to offer each other right now, they will each benefit from their trustline by being better connected to the rest of the network. For example, Dana offers gardening classes for children, and Sam's children want to attend. The pink lines represent trustlines. Sam pays Dana for gardening classes. Andy can pay for services from one of Dana's friends, and receives payments for babysitting. Similarly, Andy is a babysitter and would like Dana's connections to be able to use his babysitting skills. In return, Andy can benefit from services provided by Dana's connections. 2. Mutual Aid with a Neighborhood Timebank \u00b6 In the traditional scenario, a Berlin neighborhood may start a centralized timebank, to encourage neighbors to share skills, support their neighbors, and enrich the community. Scenario 2: Mutual Aid with a Neighborhood Timebank Trustlines allows centralized timebanks to form. These are inherently interoperable with people outside the timebank, as well as other timebanks. How to integrate with Trustlines Everyone in Berlin is eligible to join the Berlin Timebank. The community elects Dana as a manager to monitor new applications. Beth applies to join the timebank. Dana conducts an interview, in which she helps Beth figure out which skills to contribute, and what kind of requests to make. Beth signs a document committing to honor the principles of the timebank. Next, Dana has the Berlin Timebank create a trustline with Beth. The mutual credit limit on this trustline is 25, which is the same amount for all new members. There are fifty members of the timebank, including Dana. Beth can now transact with all fifty members, by rippling payments through the organization account. But Beth's overall balance with the timebank cannot go higher than 25 credits, and cannot go lower than -25 credits either. Beth offers to help Dana with her website, and enrolls her children in Dana's gardening class. Beth and Dana can pay each other time credits by rippling through the Berlin Timebank. Dana is manager of Berlin Timebank. Both Dana and Beth have trustlines with Berlin Timebank. Beth pays Dana for gardening classes. Dana pays Beth for website help. Both payments ripple through the Berlin Timebank account. Andy is a babysitter and wants to get paid for this service in time credits. But Andy is new to the neighborhood and does not feel comfortable applying for membership with a big neighborhood timebank. Luckily, Andy and Dana are good friends and share a trustline with a mutual credit limit of five. This connection enables Beth, who needs babysitting, to send a payment to Andy. Beth's payment ripples first through the Berlin Timebank, then through Dana, before ending up with Andy. Dana and Andy have a trustline. Both Dana and Beth have trustlines with Berlin Timebank. Beth pays Andy for babysitting. The payment ripples through the Berlin Timebank account and then through Dana. 3. Volunteer Groups \u00b6 Time credits can also be used for more specific purposes. For example, the manager of an altruistic community group can use Trustlines to reward volunteers for their work. An added benefit of using Trustlines is they would be better able to estimate the total number of hours their volunteers plan to contribute over a set time period. They estimate this based on the received credit limits on their trustlines. Scenario 3: Volunteer Groups Trustlines allows organizations that coordinate specific community services, like Emma's Foodsharing program in Berlin, to reward volunteers like Sam, by issuing time credits to them. Sam can spend earned credits with people and organizations that support Berlin Foodsharing. And Emma can share program statistics with her local government to demonstrate how important their work is. How to integrate with Trustlines Sam, a food delivery volunteer, opens a trustline with Berlin Foodsharing, managed by a chef, Emma. As a good rule of thumb, Sam should set the credit limit to be the maximum number of hours they expect to contribute over a set period of time. Sam expects to contribute ten hours per month, so they give Berlin Foodsharing a credit limit of ten. The other credit limit is zero for now. Emma can now pay Sam in time credits for food deliveries, using this trustline. Emma is the manager of Berlin Foodsharing. Sam has a trustline with Berlin Foodsharing. Emma uses the Berlin Foodsharing account to pay Sam for volunteering. Sam begins accumulating time credits. Every month, Sam earns ten credits and then spends ten credits with connected people and organizations. For an explanation of spending, see Scenarios 5 to 8 . But one month, Sam earns ten credits and doesn't spend them. Ten is the maximum amount of credits allowed by this credit limit. So next month, to continue earning credits, Sam agrees to raise Berlin Foodhsharing's credit limit to 20. This enables Emma to pay Sam an additional ten credits that month. Now Sam has accumulated 20 credits. But guess what, this month Sam adopts a new baby! Sam tells Emma that they will be busy parenting and no longer have time to volunteer. Sam decides to lower their credit limit to zero for now, to indicate less availability. Sam still has 20 earned credits and can spend them anytime, but can no longer earn new credits. Now Sam is deep in diapers and really needs help. It's a good time to talk to Andy, who can help out with babysitting. Andy will be able to earn credits directly from Sam, and also spend them through Sam, because of Sam's accumulated credits with Berlin Foodsharing (see Scenario 6.3 ). 4. Direct Giving through Volunteer Groups \u00b6 In a more advanced scenario, the manager of a community group could enable recipients of community services to pay volunteers directly. Using Trustlines helps the community group take a background role and act as a connector. Scenario 4: Direct Giving through Volunteer Groups Trustlines allows organizations that coordinate community services targeted towards helping vulnerable individuals, like Emma's Foodsharing program in Berlin, to act as a trusted intermediary in facilitating direct value transfers between service recipients like Fred and volunteers like Sam. How to integrate with Trustlines Berlin Foodsharing opens a trustline with each service recipient that chooses to participate. Fred is a senior citizen with reduced mobility. He applies to be a recipient of Berlin Foodsharing. Emma arranges a visit to meet Fred and assesses a need for weekly meal deliveries. So, Emma has Berlin Foodsharing give Fred a monthly credit limit of four. This is enough to pay for deliveries four times each month. The other credit limit is zero for now. This trustline enables Fred to directly pay a time credit to Sam every week, by rippling through Berlin Foodsharing. Emma is the manager of Berlin Foodsharing. Sam and Fred each have a trustline with Berlin Foodsharing. Fred pays Sam for food deliveries. The payment ripples through the Berlin Foodsharing account. At the end of the month, Fred has a balance of negative four. To make sure Fred can keep paying next month, Emma keeps track of Fred's balance. At the end of the month, Berlin Foodsharing gifts four credits to Fred, which resets his balance to zero. (Gifting is the practice of giving something voluntarily without payment in return.) This ensures that Fred can pay for next month's deliveries. Note that some months, Berlin Foodsharing doesn't have to gift any credits to Fred. That's because Fred can earn credits as well. For an explanation, see Scenario 5.2 . 5. Partnerships between Businesses and Community Groups \u00b6 Emma wants to make sure her volunteers have a way to spend their time credits. Similarly, Dana wants members of the Berlin Timebank to have more opportunities for spending and earning time credits. So, Emma and Dana start approaching businesses in the community, especially those that may have extra resources. For example, they may look for theaters that will have unused tickets or gyms that can offer free memberships. They may also look for cafes and restaurants interested in growing their business by offering discounts. A partnership is established when a business opens a trustline with a community group. In other words, they can agree to honor a certain amount of time credits as vouchers for goods or services. Using Trustlines to do this has a few added benefits for the business: Friends of community members can also transact with supporting businesses by rippling payments, which greatly expands the reach of each business (see Scenario 6.3 ). The partnership helps ensure that resources (like unused theater tickets) don't go to waste. Businesses are able to spend earned time credits back into the community. There are two ways businesses can establish partnerships with community groups: By accepting time credits as payment from the trusted group ( Scenario 5.1 ), or by gifting time credits to that group ( Scenario 5.2 ). 5.1 Partner Businesses: Growing the Local Economy \u00b6 The Berlin Timebank is known in the region as a network of reliable people with many different skills and talents, who are passionate about building a stronger community. Dana is easily able to demonstrate to several businesses that the members of the Berlin Timebank can be both a loyal customer base and a valuable resource. Scenario 5.1: Growing the Local Economy Gigi, who manages the local theater, wants to reserve a certain number of unused tickets for members of the Berlin Timebank, and for anyone connected to members of the Berlin Timebank via the network of trustlines. How to integrate with Trustlines Gigi's Theatre should open a trustline with the Berlin Timebank. Gigi gives a credit limit of 25, and the other credit limit is zero for now. Beth, who has earned time credits through the timebank, will then be able to ripple payments through the timebank to pay for theater tickets. Anyone sharing a trustline with Beth will be able to do this as well. Dana is the manager of Berlin Timebank. Dana and Gigi open a trustline between Berlin Timebank and the Theatre. Beth has a trustline with the Berlin Timebank. Beth pays Gigi's Theatre for tickets to a show. The payment ripples through the Berlin Timebank account. Afterward, Gigi's Theatre will end up being \"owed\" a number of time credits. Gigi can spend these time credits back into the community. For example, she can use them to pay theater volunteers in the future. 5.2. Partner Businesses: Gifting \u00b6 Berlin Foodsharing is highly regarded in the community and has been featured in the local paper. Emma is easily able to demonstrate to several businesses that Berlin Foodsharing is authentic: distributing time credits to real volunteers doing valuable work. So businesses wanting to give back to the community can support Berlin Foodsharing. Scenario 5.2: Gifting Heidi's Caf\u00e9 decides to gift time credits to Berlin Foodsharing to support their work. These can be redeemed as a discount (i.e., as partial payment) at the cafe. How to integrate with Trustlines Berlin Foodsharing opens a trustline with Heidi's Caf\u00e9. Berlin Foodsharing gives a credit limit of 50, and the other credit limit is zero for now. Heidi can now immediately gift 50 time credits to Berlin Foodsharing, using this trustline. Sam, a volunteer who has earned time credits from Berlin Foodsharing, will then be able to ripple payments through Berlin Foodsharing to pay at Heidi's Caf\u00e9. Anyone sharing a trustline with Sam will also be able to use this discount unless Heidi decides to limit the reward to volunteers (in that case, the caf\u00e9 must manually request proof of membership with Berlin Foodsharing before accepting the payment). Emma is the manager of Berlin Foodsharing. Emma and Heidi open a trustline between Berlin Foodsharing and the Caf\u00e9. Sam has a trustline with Berlin Foodsharing. Sam pays for coffee at Heidi's Caf\u00e9. The payment ripples through the Berlin Foodsharing account. Case A : Each month, 50 time credits are redeemed at the cafe. Heidi can choose to replenish it by gifting further time credits at the end of each month. Case B : Perhaps Heidi needs some help supporting the influx of new customers. Berlin Foodsharing can allow Heidi's Caf\u00e9 to use the trustline to access their volunteer base. Suppose volunteers from Berlin Foodsharing have already redeemed a total of 50 credits with the cafe. Heidi can offer to pay five credits out of this balance, to Sam, who agrees to help out for five hours each month. These credits are rippled through Berlin Foodsharing. Case C : But perhaps Berlin Foodsharing needs Sam, and all the other volunteers, to use the majority of their time for deliveries. Emma explains this to Heidi. To reflect this, Emma can choose to reduce their credit limit after receiving Heidi's 50 gifted credits. (This can be done even before redeeming the gifted credits.) 6. Peer-to-Peer Transactions: The Network Effect \u00b6 As described in the Decentralized Timebank ( Scenario 1 , individual community members may choose to accept time credits from other individuals, outside the constraints of a registered business. Depending on how these individuals are connected to the rest of the community, they may be able to ripple their time credits through different groups in order to make a payment to another individual or supportive business accepting time credits. 6.1. Encouraging reciprocity in community groups \u00b6 Scenario 6.1: Encouraging reciprocity in community groups Perhaps Fred is also a retired professor. Fred can offer tutoring services to Sam, who has children. Fred can accept time credits in return. How to integrate with Trustlines Fred has rippled payments in the past to Sam, through Berlin Foodsharing. Now, Sam can use these earned time credits to ripple a payment in the other direction, back to Fred. Sam and Fred each have a trustline with Berlin Foodsharing. Sam pays Fred for tutoring Sam's children. The payment ripples through the Berlin Foodsharing account. 6.2. Creating new friendships because of community groups \u00b6 Scenario 6.2: Creating new friendships because of community groups Alternatively, suppose Sam has been delivering meals to Fred for months, so they know and trust each other. They can choose to start transacting directly, without using Berlin Foodsharing. How to integrate with Trustlines Fred can open a trustline directly with Sam, and they agree to set a mutual credit limit of ten---higher than what Berlin Foodsharing allows. Then Sam can use this trustline to pay Fred for tutoring services for Sam's children, and Fred can use the trustline to pay for meal deliveries. They no longer need to ripple payments through Berlin Foodsharing. Sam and Fred open a trustline between each other. Fred pays Sam for food deliveries. Sam pays Fred for tutoring Sam's children. 6.3. Rippling through friends to shop at local businesses \u00b6 Scenario 6.2: Rippling through friends to shop at local businesses Remember that Sam has a neighbor named Andy. Sam often uses time credits to pay Andy for babysitting. Andy can redeem his time credits at local businesses, even though he does not have trustlines with any of them, because he is connected through Sam. How to integrate with Trustlines Andy already has a trustline with Sam. Since Andy is receiving time credits from Sam, who is a member of Berlin Foodsharing, Andy could eventually ripple a payment through Sam to pay for a discount at Heidi's Caf\u00e9. Andy and Sam have a trustline. Sam has paid Andy for babysitting. Berlin Foodsharing and Heidi's Caf\u00e9 have a trustline. Andy pays for hot chocolate at Heidi's Caf\u00e9. The payment ripples through Sam, then through the Berlin Foodsharing account. 7. Community Partnerships: The Network Effect \u00b6 Different community groups can open trustlines between each other as well, allowing payments to ripple through each one's members and network of partner businesses, and thus expanding the network of all members. Scenario 7: The Network Effect The Berlin Timebank (managed by Dana) and the Paris Timebank, a similar program managed by Ivan, want to connect their members, and also share their network of partner businesses. How to integrate with Trustlines The Berlin Timebank can open a trustline with the Paris Timebank. Dana and Ivan agree on a mutual credit limit of 25. This is the maximum amount either group can have \"outstanding\" at any point in time, between their communities. This connection enables members of both programs to spend and earn time credits in each other's communities, by rippling payments over the trustline. For example, this enables C\u00f4me, a member of the Paris Timebank, to use time credits while visiting Berlin, in order to pay for a theater ticket. Dana is the manager of the Berlin Timebank. Ivan is the manager of the Paris Timebank. They open a trustline between the two timebanks. C\u00f4me pays for theatre tickets at Gigi's Theatre. The payment ripples through the Paris Timebank account and then the Berlin Timebank account. This is possible because C\u00f4me has a trustline with the Paris Timebank, and there is a trustline connecting the Berlin Timebank to Gigi's Theatre. 8. Partner Businesses: Supporting Networks of Communities \u00b6 Businesses may also choose to accept time credits from a large and diverse set of community groups. Scenario 8: Supporting Networks of Communities Josh is the community organizer managing a European Timebank Network. Kamal, an online crafts seller from London, wants to support mutual aid initiatives using timebanks, and also grow his customer base. He decides to offer a discount to the European Timebank Network. This would open Kamal's offer to timebanks across Europe, like the Berlin Timebank or the Paris Timebank. How to integrate with Trustlines Kamal reaches out to Josh to explain why he supports their organization and to introduce his crafts shop. Josh agrees that connecting to Kamal's Craft Shop will add value to the European Timebank Network, since it is a unique shop where members can spend their credits. They agree to open a trustline. The European Timebank Network gives a credit limit of 20 to Kamal, and the other credit limit is zero for now. Kamal immediately uses this trustline to gift 20 time credits to the organization. Now, the European Timebank Network has a balance of 20 credits to spend at Kamal's Craft Shop, to be used as a discount. The European Timebank Network has trustlines with many timebanks across the continent, each of which has a mutual credit limit of 25. Because of this, connected timebank members like Beth can redeem their time credits for crafts by rippling a payment to Kamal's Craft Shop. In this scenario, Beth's payment would ripple first through the Berlin Timebank, and then through the European Timebank Network, until finally it is paid to Kamal. Josh is the manager of the European Timebank Network. He opens a trustline with Kamal's Craft Shop. Beth has a trustline with the Berlin Timebank. Beth pays for handmade crafts at Kamal's Craft Shop. The payment ripples through the Berlin Timebank and then the European Timebank Network. After accumulating credits over this trustline, Kamal can choose to pay some credits back into the community. Since Kamal lives in London, he checks the directory of the London Timebank to see what services are available. He will be able to ripple a payment through the European Timebank Network, and then through the London Timebank, before it is received by someone in his community.","title":"Time Credits - User Stories"},{"location":"use_cases/time_credits/time_credits_user_stories/#1-decentralized-timebank","text":"The easiest way to start using time credits is to join the decentralized timebank.

They estimate this based on the received credit limits on their trustlines. Scenario 3: Volunteer Groups Trustlines allows organizations that coordinate specific community services, like Emma's Foodsharing program in Berlin, to reward volunteers like Sam, by issuing time credits to them. Sam can spend earned credits with people and organizations that support Berlin Foodsharing.
